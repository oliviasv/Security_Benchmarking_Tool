  description : "1.1 Ensure Device is running JTAC Recommended Software Release"
  info        : "All JUNOS Devices should run the current JTAC Recommended Release of JUNOS.

Rationale:
As with any software, the JUNOS Operating System installed on Juniper Devices may be subject to Bugs, Updates and Vulnerabilities discovered over time.
Juniper periodically issues software patches available for all Juniper Devices which are currently supported and for which the operating organizations has a valid support contract.
All JUNOS Devices in a production network should be updated and run the current JTAC (Juniper Technical Assistance Center) Recommended Release for the platform, which is specified in Juniper Knowledge Base Article KB21476.
If you have a Login to the Juniper Customer Portal, you can subscribe to this KB Article, so that you receive email alerts whenever the current JTAC Recommended Release is changed or updated.
You should only operate a version other than that listed in KB24176 in a production environment when specifically instructed to do so by JTAC in order to resolve an issue.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
  solution    : "Upload the current JTAC Recommended Release to the JUNOS Device in the /var/tmp/ folder.
In most cases an upgrade is performed with the following command, issued from Operational Mode:
user@host> request system software add /var/tmp/<image name>
Where <image name> is the filename of the JUNOS image provided by Juniper.

NOTE - Updating JUNOS Software with this command will result in a reboot of the system and loss of service.
In platforms deployed with redundant Routing Engines, as Virtual Chassis or as HA Clusters, In-Service Software Updates (or ISSU) may be supported. An ISSU update updates and reboots each node or RE separately, failing services on to the other node/RE prior to the reboot.
To perform an ISSU Update, on most platforms, issue the the following command from Operational Mode:
user@host> request system software in-service-upgrade /var/tmp/<image name>

NOTE - The specific procedure and prerequisites for ISSU varies by platform and deployment type. If some prerequisites (such as NSR or GRES) are not correctly configured a loss of service may still occur.
Please refer to the documentation for your platform before attempting to update software.

Impact:
During updates JUNOS Devices reboot to load the new software. In some instances this may result in loss of service. Please refer to the documentation for your platform before attempting to update software.

Default Value:
JUNOS Devices do not always ship with the current JTAC Recommended Release installed."

  description : "1.2 Ensure End of Life JUNOS Devices are not used"
  info        : "EoL JUNOS Devices should never be used in production networks

Rationale:
As with most vendors, Juniper Networks only support individual versions of Software and Hardware for a certain period of time in order to allow resources to be spent developing new products, rather than supporting old ones and because new features and technologies may not be supportable on older hardware.
Juniper will announce that support for a device, software version or platform is being discontinued by issuing an End of Life Notice for the product being retired. A typical EOL Notice will include details of:
- Notification Date - The official date that the EOLN was issued, all other timings are based on this date.
- LOD - the Last Order Date for the product - typically this is 180 days after the EOLN. After LOD, no new support services or contracts for the product can be purchased.
- LSV - the Last Software Version which will be supported for the product
- EOSE - the End of Software Engineering. After this date Juniper will not offer new bug fixes or software patches for the product. Typically this is 3 years after the EOLN.
- LRD - the Last Renewal Date. After this date, existing support contracts and services for the platform can no longer be renewed. Typically this is 4 years after the EOLN.
- EOS - the End of Support. Juniper will no longer provide any support or replacements for the platform. Typically this is 5 years after the EOLN.
Once a device has reached EOSE state, Juniper may no longer offer any patches, bug fixes or fixes for security vulnerabilities. This makes the device essentially unsupportable in a production environment, as any serious vulnerability discovered could not be patched.
It may not be practical in most cases to provide a work around without impacting services and it is rarely possible to instantly retire or replace affected platforms in response to a newly discovered vulnerability. This would leave networks vulnerable with no prospect of a timely fix.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
  solution    : "Administrators should plan to retire all JUNOS Devices before they reach EOS/EOSE

Impact:
EOL Devices of any type present a significant risk to the security of the network."

  description : "1.3 Ensure device is physically secured"
  info        : "Network Devices should be physically secured.

Rationale:
As with most information assets, it is vital that an attacker is prevented from gaining physical access to your Juniper JUNOS Devices.
With physical access an attacker may bypass firewalls by re-patching systems, power off your Device or connect to Console ports.
It is possible with almost all network equipment to reset the Root password if you have physical access.
Recommendations elsewhere in this document provide some mitigation against these attacks by, for example, Encrypting Configuration files and disabling Auxiliary Ports, but preventing or detecting physical access to your network devices should still be a fundamental element of a defense in depth strategy.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
  solution    : "While preventing all physical access is nearly impossible in some deployment scenarios, such as for a Service Provider supplying Customer Premises Equipment (CPE), in most cases the following minimum steps should be considered:
- The JUNOS Device should be deployed in a secure, locked room.
- Access logs should be maintained for the room, either electronically through use of access cards or through a manual process for access to the key.
- Access to the room should be limited to only those personnel absolutely required.
- Use of CCTV to monitor sensitive areas and comms rooms.
- The room should ideally be equipped with Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) and cooling facilities as well as be free from Electromagnetic Interference sources. Loss of power (either malicious or accidental) or cooling can result in a loss of service.
These methods should be a bare minimum and other physical security options considered when protecting a JUNOS Device which processes or transits sensitive data, such as Encryption Keys, Credit Card or Personally Identifiable Information which may be in scope for regulatory/industry compliance standards such as PCI DSS, GDPR or HIPAA.
In these situation Secure Hosting or Co-Location Facilities may be required and options considered for Physical Security should include:
- 24/7 Security Guards and Monitoring
- Biometric and/or Multi Factor access control
- Private Caged areas for secure equipment
- Additional alarm and monitoring systems to detect equipment being removed from racks"

  description : "1.4 Ensure configuration is backed up on a regular schedule"
  info        : "Regular backups should be made of the router.

Rationale:
Backups of a routers configuration may be necessary when recovering from physical hardware failure, administrative errors or a successful attack. Preserving the evidence of an attack may also be necessary for regulatory compliance, forensic investigation or prosecution of the attacker.
By default, JUNOS routers save a local backup copy of your configuration every time you commit (save) a change. JUNOS maintains the 50 previous configuration files, 4 on the Routing Engines Flash drive and the remainder on the hard disk.
This provides a useful method to recover from many types of fault or error, however an attacker will, potentially, be in a position to compromise these backups along with the active configuration, so it is vital that you also keep a remote configuration backup beyond the attackers reach.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
  solution    : "A discussion of all possible backup methods is beyond the scope of this Benchmark.
Consider the Archival section of this Benchmark for one method of obtaining remote backups whenever your configuration is changed.
CVS tools such as RANCID provide an alternative method to backup and manage configuration files from a central location as well as keeping track of changes over time.
Also consider a method of maintaining offline copies of your backup data, such as tape storage. This provides a vital tool in Disaster Recovery and is also extremely helpful when recovering from a successful attack, as you can be certain that the attacker was unable to alter the offline version."

  description : "1.5 Ensure backup data is stored and transferred securely"
  info        : "Backups of router configuration should be secured.

Rationale:
If an attacker has access to your router configuration files they have gained a lot of sensitive information about your network topology, defenses, weaknesses, critical servers and possibly your VPN keys and login information.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
  solution    : "A discussion of securing your backup services is beyond the scope of this Benchmark, but at a minimum you should consider the following:
- Never transfer configuration files using plain text protocols such as Telnet or FTP. Use SSH or SCP instead.
- Restrict access to backups to the least number of administrative users possible.
- Store offline backups in a physically secure, fire resistant, air tight safe.
- Log access and changes to backups.
- Secure any server that stores backups using the appropriate Center for Internet Security Benchmark.
- Disable all unused services on the backup server."

<report type:"WARNING">
  description : "1.6 Ensure maximum RAM is installed"
  info        : "The router should have the maximum RAM installed.

Rationale:
Some Denial of Service attacks rely on exhausting the target routers memory resources by bombarding the router with bogus requests or traffic, when the router runs out of memory it will stop being able to service genuine requests and may be unable to perform critical tasks like maintaining route tables.
Juniper routers are somewhat more resilient to this type of attack then some other systems due to the separation of the Control and Forwarding planes, but attacks against router services may still cause disruption.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
  solution    : "Installing the most RAM available for your system will both help to mitigate these attacks and boost performance of your routers. In most cases RAM upgrades are extremely cost effective way to increase router performance and survivability."

  description : "1.7 Ensure logging data is monitored"
  info        : "Logs and events should be monitored.

Rationale:
Even after you have applied all of the settings in this guide, there is no such thing as perfect security. All systems are potentially vulnerable, be it to undiscovered software bugs, social engineering or other risks.
System logs, SNMP traps and any other information generated by your network devices should be monitored for changes and suspicious activity at least daily. Remember that your TACACS+ or RADIUS server may also produce logs detailing logins and what commands users issue.
If your systems produce more logging then you can actively monitor, consider using a Security Information and Event Manager type system. SIEM software consolidates and analyzes log information from across your organization, detecting security incidents and providing detailed, joined up information to aide your incident response and investigation.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
  solution    : "Some popular SIEM systems include:
  - Juniper Secure Analytics (JSA)
  - RSA NetWitness
  - IBM QRadar (Which is also the basis of the Juniper JSA product)
  - AlienVault USM
  - OSSIM (now also operated by AlienVault)
  - Splunk
  This is not intended as a recommendation of individual SIEM or SIM products, nor as an exhaustive list."

  description : "1.8 Ensure Retired JUNOS Devices are Disposed of Securely"
  info        : "JUNOS Devices must be disposed of securely

Rationale:
As with all systems, there will come a point where a JUNOS Device has reached the end of it's service and must either be redeployed, recycled or disposed of.
JUNOS Devices used in production will typically contain a significant store of sensitive information, which may include:
- Configuration details about your network and services
- Sensitive or Personal data traversing the network, stored in packet captures, trace output or log files
- Hashed Passwords and Shared Secrets for users, management platforms or Virtual Private Networks
- Encryption Keys and other sensitive keying material used for IPSEC VPNs, X.509 Certificates or other uses
Attackers may attempt to gain information on potential targets or sensitive data by acquiring retired network devices and servers through theft, recycling services or online auctions. It is not uncommon to purchase used JUNOS Devices on sites like Ebay and find that the old configuration, encryption keys, licenses and other details are still present.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
  solution    : "To ensure that sensitive data is not lost when disposing of or redeploying retired JUNOS Devices, it is essential that the system be fully zeroized. This process returns the system to its original factory default state, with no root password set and all configuration, backups, user specified options, encryption keys, etc deleted.
To zeroize a JUNOS Device, log in as a user with the maintenance permission or as root and issue the following command from Operational Mode:
root@host>request system zeroize media
The media option used above also undertakes a process to securely 'scrub' onboard memory and persistent media (such as flash, HDDs or SSDs) using a method equivalent to 'clearing' as specified in NIST SP800-88. Using the media option will take significantly more time, as it repeatedly overwrites every area of storage with random data, but is strongly recommended for all devices where the option is supported.
An increasing number of JUNOS Devices, such as the PTX5000 Series and some MX Series routers, utilize a Disaggregated JUNOS Operating System which hosts JUNOS as a Virtual Machine abstracting it from the physical Routing Engine hardware. In some instances the request system zeroize command will zeroize the Guest JUNOS VM only, and not the underlying Host OS. For these platforms the following command should be used from Operational Mode:
root@host>request vmhost zeroize
This command will clear both the JUNOS VM and the Host OS.
When some devices, such as EX or QFX Series, are deployed in Clusters, HA or Virtual Chassis environments the request system zeroize media command may be ignored or may operate on only the local node, so will need to be issued individually on each device being disposed of.
Ensure you check the current documentation for the request system zeroize command for your platform to ensure that all options are correctly specified and perform the operation as intended.
Where possible, devices which are being 'returned to base' from a deployment using third parties for transport should be zeroized before shipping."

    Rationale:
    Some JUNOS routers support the use of a dial in modem connection for Telnet/SSH administration of the router from a remote connection over the telephone network.
    This can provide a useful out of band management channel, allowing access to a customer router at a remote site when the primary circuit has failed for example, but also creates a new route for attack, allowing a malicious user to bypass firewalls and other defenses.

    Rationale:
    Where it is deployed, External BGP routing is vital for normal operation of an organization's network infrastructure. Correct route information is required for routers to correctly direct traffic destined for external networks. An attacker may attempt to exhaust the routers CPU and memory resources by flooding a target router with fake routing updates, resulting in a DoS condition. Potentially an attack may also inject fake routing information into the route table.
    General TTL Security Mechanism (GTSM) is defined in RFC5082 and takes advantage of the fact that routers normally peer with adjacent neighbors, i.e. with routers only 1 hop away. GTSM uses the Time to Live (TTL) field of routing update packets to determine whether or not the packet originated from an adjacent router, denying those which do not.
    Juniper routers effectively implement GTSM by default. Administrators can use the multihop command hierarchy to increase the maximum acceptable TTL for route updates, allowing updates from non adjacent peers. When peering with adjacent routers then multihop should not be configured, using the default to effectively configure GTSM with a TTL limit of 254 (or 1 hop). If your network requires peering with routers more than 1 hop away (non adjacent peers), multihop should be configured on a per peer or per group basis with the minimum possible value so as to limit the distance, in terms of networks, from which an attack can be launched."

    [edit protocols bgp]
    user@host#delete multihop
    To change the number of hops distance from which a route update can originate, enter the following command from the [edit protocols bgp group <group name>] to apply multihop to a group or [edit protocols bgp group <group name> neighbor <neighbor address>] to apply multihop to a single neighbor;

Passwords are stored, automatically by JUNOS, as a MD5 hash in the configuration under the [edit system diag-port-authentication] hierarchy.
A complex password should be employed which meets or exceeds the following requirements:
- Does not contain Dictionary words, names, dates, phone numbers or addresses.
- Is at least 8 characters in length (longer is recommended).
- Contains at least one each of upper & lower case letters, numbers and special characters.
- Avoids more than 4 digits or same case letters in a row.

Rationale:
ICMP Source Quench messages are intended to allow a host to request that a peer with which it is communicating slows down the transmission of new data because the host is being overwhelmed.
Several recorded vulnerabilities have shown how Source Quench messages may be abused by an attacker to create a DoS attack, causing the router to slow down transmission of data to one, several or all destinations. Due to these vulnerabilities, and the general ineffectiveness of Source Quench for congestion control, RFC6633 deprecated its use and ICMP Source Quench should be disabled."

Rationale:
As with most Operating Systems, by default, when a client attempts to connect to a TCP port which is not being used by a service to listen for connections JUNOS will return a TCP RST message to inform the client that there is no service available on that port.
This behavior may aide an attacker who is performing port scanning to identify open services as part of a reconnaissance of the network or may allow Denial of Service (DoS) attack to be performed by placing unnecessary processing load on the Routing Engine.
No valid use exists for attempting to connect to non-listening ports on a router or other network device, so JUNOS should be configured to silently drop all packets (with any flags) sent to closed TCP ports without sending a TCP reset (RST).

Controlling the level of access which users are granted when logging into a router, helps protect against both malicious attacks and accidental misconfiguration of the router by less experienced staff.
Configuring user permissions on a user by user basis can quickly become unwieldy and difficult to manage, potentially leading to mistakes with a serious impact on the routers security. Instead, permissions should be assigned to classes to which individual users are linked in order to grant the appropriate level of access that corresponds with their job role.
JUNOS provides 4 built in Login Classes:
- Operator (can perform operational commands like ping but cannot view or edit the configuration or reboot the device)
- read-only (can view configuration and perform some operational commands)
- super-user (can issue any command)
- unauthorized (can login, but cannot perform any actions except for logging out)
In addition to the built in classes, JUNOS allows administrators to configure Custom Login Classes and to permit or deny additional permissions through Vendor Specific Attributes used with External AAA Servers like RADIUS or TACACS+.
Because a user account, whether being used for a local user or used as a template for logins from External AAA, will be placed in the highly privileged `super-user' class by default - it is essential that all user accounts be explicitly configured with the required login class, even when further restrictions are being applied through permit/deny commands by External AAA."

JUNOS routers ship with 4 Predefined Login Classes, these are:
- super-user

These classes provide basic configuration to allow organizations to get a router up and running, but do not provide fine grained control needed by all but very smallest organizations.
The built in classes also do not meet the other recommendations in this section. For example, the super-user class (which is the only built in class with read/write permissions) also has permission to start a Unix Shell and does not have an Idle Session Timeout.
Because of these limitations it is recommended that Custom Login Classes be defined following the principle of least privilege, where each class of users is granted only those permissions needed to complete their job role.
All of these class should meet the other requirements in this section and no users (either local or remote template users) should use the built-in accounts."

Impact:
Careful configuration of permissions following the least privilege principle is essential for secure and reliable management of the network.

By applying a hashing algorithm to the password before storing it, JUNOS limits an attacker's ability to gain passwords from configuration backups or to escalate privileges when using a different account through the CLI.
JUNOS hashes local passwords using MD5, or SHA1 for FIPS mode devices, by default. However, both are older algorithms and are widely considered to be weak for this type of usage.

  description : "6.6.13 Ensure SSH Key Authentication is not set for User Logins"
  info        : "SSH Key Based Authentication should not be used for User Logins

Rationale:
Due to the sensitive nature of SSH, potentially allowing full management of the targeted device, protecting SSH access using strong authentication methods is essential to the security of the device.
One method which is supported in SSH for stronger authentication is the use of Public/Private Encryption Key Pairs in place of a more traditional login prompt for a Username and Password. Instead, an administrator uploads the user's Public key to the JUNOS (or other) device to be managed.
When the user connects, they will use their Private key to encrypt some session specific data. The JUNOS device can verify the Users identity by decrypting that data using the Public key configured previously and comparing it to an expected result. If the results match, then the user must have access to the Private key, so is considered valid.
Unfortunately using SSH Keys to authenticate User Logins to JUNOS devices introduce a number of security issues:
- Public Keys may only be configured locally on each JUNOS device
- Public Keys are used instead of centralized AAA using TACACS+ or RADIUS as covered in Recommendation 6.8.1 Ensure External AAA Server is set
- The use of SSH Keys means only a single Authentication Factor (the keys) can be used, preventing the use of Multi Factor Authentication as covered in 6.6.14 Ensure Multi-Factor is used with External AAA
- JUNOS does not provide any method to automate rollover or locking of keys. If keys are compromised/lost, they must be changed on every JUNOS device on which they are configured.
- Some SSH implementation support the use of X.509 PKI Certificates for managing SSH Keys, but JUNOS does not.
Because of these limitations and the difficulty in auditing and managing SSH Keys on JUNOS devices, this method should not be used for Authentication of User logins or for the Root User.
In some instances, such as when using PyEZ or NETCONF based automation over SSH, it may be preferable to authenticate a limited number of automation services using SSH Keys, rather than 'hard coding' user details into scripts. Where this is the case, it is imperative to have strong key management procedures in use to control and audit access to the Private Keys used and a process to allow for rollover and revocation of compromised keys."
  solution    : "For each User Login configured with SSH Key based Authentication, you can delete the SSH Key with the following command from the [edit system login] hierarchy:
[edit system login]
user@host# delete user <User ID> authentication
The user can then be configured with a password locally or, inline with Recommendation 6.8.1 Ensure External AAA Server is set , leave the authentication method blank and allow the External AAA to control Authentication.
Alternatively, you may wish to delete the local user account entirely using the following command:
[edit system login]
user@host# delete user <User ID>

Impact:
Careful configuration of permissions following the least privilege principle is essential for secure and reliable management of the network.
When configuring remote AAA, it is recommended that a local Emergency Access Account also be configured to allow management of the device in the event that AAA services are unavailable.

Rationale:
Keeping time settings consistent across a network is vital if log data is to be meaningful and usable in understanding faults and security incidents. Consistent time settings are also vital to the operation of some network protocols and services such as IPSec and 802.1x which may be critical to many networks.
To ensure that the time on your JUNOS router is consistent with other devices in your network, at least two NTP Servers external to the device should be configured.
Although NTP provides for a Peer to Peer type implementation, where individual time servers are not specified and methods such as broadcast and multicast are utilized to synchronize time between hosts, in almost all real world cases a Server / Client model should be used for network devices - even if multicast or broadcast methods are used for other types of hosts. Using specified time sources allows you to better secure, monitor and manage your NTP implementation; simplifying debugging and allowing tighter control of NTP traffic.
Having multiple NTP servers ensures fault tolerance and also protects against mis-configured or compromised servers causing radical time changes, something an attacker may want to achieve to cover their tracks or conduct replay attacks."

    Rationale:
    RADIUS is a centralized Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) protocol providing services to authenticate users on routers, switches and other systems.
    By default, JUNOS devices which are configured to use RADIUS for External AAA use the Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) for Authenticating users. PAP is an old standard, dating back to Dial-up Internet connections where interception was not considered viable; so PAP sends the user's password in plain-text (unencrypted) over the network to the RADIUS server, exposing the password to interception and misuse.
    All current JUNOS devices support the use of the stronger MS-CHAPv2 (Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol, Version 2) standard for user Authentication, which is widely supported.
    With CHAP, the password is never sent over the network. Instead a 'challenge' is encrypted by the RADIUS Server and sent to the JUNOS device, which decrypts the challenge using the configured Secret. The JUNOS device combines the the decrypted Challenge with the password provided by the user into a Hash, which is returned to the RADIUS Server which performs the same Hash of the Challenge and the users password to determine whether to permit or deny the request.
    Use of MS-CHAPv2 on JUNOS Devices also allows for users to change their password if the password has expired.

      info        : "MS-CHAPv2 should be used for RADIUS authentication if RADIUS Servers are configured

  Rationale:
  RADIUS is a centralized Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) protocol providing services to authenticate users on routers, switches and other systems.
  By default, JUNOS devices which are configured to use RADIUS for External AAA use the Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) for Authenticating users. PAP is an old standard, dating back to Dial-up Internet connections where interception was not considered viable; so PAP sends the user's password in plain-text (unencrypted) over the network to the RADIUS server, exposing the password to interception and misuse.
  All current JUNOS devices support the use of the stronger MS-CHAPv2 (Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol, Version 2) standard for user Authentication, which is widely supported.
  With CHAP, the password is never sent over the network. Instead a 'challenge' is encrypted by the RADIUS Server and sent to the JUNOS device, which decrypts the challenge using the configured Secret. The JUNOS device combines the the decrypted Challenge with the password provided by the user into a Hash, which is returned to the RADIUS Server which performs the same Hash of the Challenge and the users password to determine whether to permit or deny the request.
  Use of MS-CHAPv2 on JUNOS Devices also allows for users to change their password if the password has expired.
  Where RADIUS Servers are configured for External AAA, it is recommended that MS-CHAPv2 be used instead of, the default, PAP standard for user Authentication.

  NOTE: RADIUS does not appear to be used on the target. This check is not applicable."

  description     : "6.8.5 Ensure Source-Address is set for External AAA Servers"
  info            : "The Source-Address should be set for each External AAA Server configured

Rationale:
RADIUS and TACACS+ are centralized Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) services.
Both protocols provide services to Authenticate users on routers, switches and other systems. Juniper devices support both RADIUS and TACACS+ Authentication and you should configure at least one External Authentication Server of either type.
For resilience it is generally recommended to configure multiple AAA Servers, which can be of the same type (both TACACS+ or both RADIUS) or can be mixed (one RADIUS and one TACACS+) as required so long as both are configured in [edit system authentication-order].
RADIUS and TACACS+ servers are sensitive systems and should typically be protected by Firewall Filters and ACLs on the RADIUS/TACACS+ Service restricting the Source Address of valid clients. To ensure that these restrictions can be correctly, and strictly, applied - it is important to ensure that the Juniper device always uses the same Source Address when sending packets to these services, irrespective of the route being used.
To do this you should explicitly set the Source Address used for each server (these can be different addresses for different individual servers if required). Typically either the Loopback Address (assigned to Lo0.0) or Out of Band Management address (assigned to FXP0.0) in the Default/Master Virtual Router instance should be used as the Source Address."
  solution        : "Configure at least one External Authentication Server using the following commands under the [edit system] hierarchy; For RADIUS
[edit system]
user@host#set radius-server <server ip> secret <shared secret> source-address <loopback IP>
Or for TACACS+
[edit system]
user@host#set tacplus-server <server ip> secret <shared secret> source-address <loopback IP>

Impact:
Ensure that External AAA Servers are tested prior to deploying in a live environment.
It is generally recommended to configure a single 'Rescue' or 'Emergency' account locally under the [edit system login] hierarchy to provide access in the event of a AAA failure or mis-configuration prior to deploying External AAA.

  info        : "A complex Root Password should be set for the system.

Rationale:
Due to the importance of the Root user account, which has full control of the JUNOS system and underlying Unix OS, a complex password should be employed to help prevent attackers employing 'brute force' or 'dictionary' attacks to gain full control of the router. Passwords are stored, automatically by JUNOS, as a SHA1 hash in the configuration under the [edit system root-authentication] hierarchy.
A complex password should be employed which meets or exceeds the following requirements:
- Does not contain Dictionary words, names, dates, phone numbers or addresses.
- Is at least 8 characters in length.
- Contains at least one each of upper & lower case letters, numbers and special characters.
- Avoids more than 4 digits or same case letters in a row.
Because Root Authentication must be set before JUNOS will permit the first configuration commit on a new JUNOS system, password complexity requirements covered in other Recommendations may not yet be configured and do not apply to passwords retrospectively. Therefore it is important to manually ensure that a complex password is used for the Root account."

You will be prompted to enter the new Password twice and, if the Passwords match, JUNOS will add a SHA1 hash of the Password to the configuration.
Alternatively, if you are copying the configuration from an existing JUNOS system (using the same hashing algorithm) or template, you may apply an existing hash of the Root password:
[edit system]
user@host#set root-authentication encrypted-password '<hash>'

Impact:
Root Authentication must be set prior to JUNOS allowing the first commit on a new system.

  info        : "The Root Password should be unique.

Rationale:
Due to the rights associated with the Root user account it must be protected at all costs to prevent malicious users taking ownership of the router.
Using the same password for an individual User or other usage exposes the extremely privileged Root user account to abuse by that user and introduces the need to manually change the Root password should that user leave the organization.
Further risks are presented by the lower level hashing algorithm which may be used to protect other system passwords. On some JUNOS systems or External AAA platforms these utilize MD5, a demonstrably less secure protocol then SHA1 which used for the Root password. Theoretically an attacker could exploit the weaker hashing used on these lesser system passwords to recover the Root password.
Finally, the Root password should not be reused on other systems, including other routers, and should be stored securely - such as using a Password Manager. If the Root Password was the same across all of the routers and other systems in your network, the compromise of one host could result in the compromise of all hosts.

  description : "6.9.3 Ensure SSH Key Authentication is not set for Root Login"
  info        : "SSH Key Based Authentication should not be used for Root Login

Rationale:
Due to the sensitive nature of SSH, potentially allowing full management of the targeted device, protecting SSH access using strong authentication methods is essential to the security of the device.
One method which is supported in SSH for stronger authentication is the use of Public/Private Encryption Key Pairs in place of a more traditional login prompt for a Username and Password. Instead, an administrator uploads the user's Public key to the JUNOS (or other) device to be managed.
When the user connects, they will use their Private key to encrypt some session specific data. The JUNOS device can verify the Users identity by decrypting that data using the Public key configured previously and comparing it to an expected result. If the results match, then the user must have access to the Private key, so is considered valid.
Unfortunately using SSH Keys to authenticate User Logins to JUNOS devices introduce a number of security issues:
- Public Keys may only be configured locally on each JUNOS device
- Public Keys are used instead of centralized AAA using TACACS+ or RADIUS as covered in Recommendation 6.8.1 Ensure External AAA Server is set
- The use of SSH Keys means only a single Authentication Factor (the keys) can be used, preventing the use of Multi Factor Authentication as covered in 6.6.14 Ensure Multi-Factor is used with External AAA
- JUNOS does not provide any method to automate rollover or locking of keys. If keys are compromised/lost, they must be changed on every JUNOS device on which they are configured.
- Some SSH implementation support the use of X.509 PKI Certificates for managing SSH Keys, but JUNOS does not.
Because of these limitations and the difficulty in auditing and managing SSH Keys on JUNOS devices, this method should not be used for Authentication of User logins or for the Root User, which is configured separately under the [edit system root-authentication] configuration hierarchy."
  solution    : "If SSH Key based Authentication is configured for the Root Authentication, remove it using the following command from the [edit system] hierarchy:

NOTE - Hashes use SHA1 by default, but may use other hashing mechanisms depending on the device configuration - ensure the device you are copying from is configured to use the same hashing method.
If JWEB is installed on your router, the Root Password may also be changed through the Configuration > Quick Configuration > Setup page.

  description : "6.10.1.11 Ensure Strong Key Signing Algorithms are set for SSH"
  info        : "SSH should be configured with strong key signing algorithms

Rationale:
SSH (Secure Shell) is the defacto standard protocol used for remote administration of network devices and Unix servers, providing an encrypted and authenticated alternative to Telnet. However, this ubiquity and requirement to support a wide range of clients and deployment scenarios, as well as SSH's age, mean SSH needs to support a variety of Ciphers of varying strengths.
By default, for the widest range of client compatibility, JUNOS supports SSH Key Signing methods using older algorithms and methods such as 1024 bit DSA keys.
SSH is a vital tool for administering most JUNOS devices, providing privileged access and potentially transporting sensitive information including passwords. It is recommended that SSH sessions be protected by restricting JUNOS to using stronger Key Signing methods based on RSA or Elliptic Curve algorithms, while weaker signing methods are explicitly disabled."
  solution    : "To explicitly disable DSA signatures, type the following command at the [edit system services ssh] hierarchy:
[edit system services ssh]
user@host#show hostkey-algorithm no-ssh-dss

[edit system services ssh]
user@host#show hostkey-algorithm ssh-ecdsa
user@host#show hostkey-algorithm ssh-ed25519
user@host#show hostkey-algorithm ssh-rsa

Default Value:
For most platforms SSH-ECDSA, SSH-ED25519, SSH-DSS (1024 bit DSA keys) and SSH-RSA are permitted by default.
SSH-DSS is not supported on JUNOS in FIPS Mode, so cannot be enabled in FIPS mode."

When hardening any computer system for security, it is important to disable or uninstall any application that is not required. The same rule applies to routers and other network devices.
JUNOS devices are able to operate as a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server, providing IP Address and other information to client systems on connected networks. DHCP Services are configured either under the [edit system services dhcp] (using the Legacy DHCPD process) or [edit system services dhcp-local-server] (using the newer Extended JDHCPD process) hierarchies.
In most larger environments, DHCP services will be provided by separate DHCP Servers rather than JUNOS Routers, Switches or Firewalls - although these may still be used in smaller networks or Branch Offices. On some JUNOS platforms the DHCP Service is configured by default, but it is recommended that it is disabled if it is not required."

Rationale:
Log information from a JUNOS Device can be vital in detecting an attack and to allow incidents to be analyzed, investigated and (where appropriate) prosecuted. SYSLOG information is also helpful in diagnosing and resolving non-security related operational issues on the network.
Because of this, one of the first tasks an attacker will attempt to accomplish after gaining access to a Network Device is to alter or delete logs to cover their tracks.
To prevent an attacker or a fault denying you access to log data, it is vital to send logs to at least one External Logging and/or SIEM (Security Incident and Event Manager) Server. JUNOS Devices use the industry standard SYSLOG protocol for this.
SYSLOG entries are generated by a range of sources on a JUNOS Device, such as authorization which reports Authentication and Authorization events or PFE for events encountered by the Packet Forwarding Engine. Each of these sources are referred to as a Facility.
In addition to indicating what facility generated a log message, JUNOS SYSLOG also indicates and allows the administrator to filter based on the Severity Level for each message. There are eight possible levels, which are as follows:
- Emergency (0)
- Alert (1)
- Critical (2)
- Error (3)
- Warning (4)
- Notice (5)
- Informational (6)
- Any (7) (called Debug on many SYSLOG systems)
Each increase in level represents an increase in the detail and number of log messages created. Each level includes the messages from all preceding levels, so Critical includes all messages from both the Alert and Emergency levels.
To ensure that vital messages about the Health and Security of the JUNOS Device are not missed, or lost should an attacker delete local logs, at least one External SYSLOG or SIEM Server should be configured to receive log messages from any Facility and at least info Severity."
  solution        : "SYSLOG data is recorded locally by default, you can configure external SYSLOG servers by issuing the following command from the [edit system syslog] hierarchy;
[edit system syslog]
user@host#set host <Server> any <Severity>
Where:
- <Server> is the IP Address or Fully Qualified Domain Name of the Remote Syslog Server
- <Severity> should be either any or info
Some SYSLOG or SIEM Servers may require additional configuration items such as explicit-priority or structured-data options to be configured.
It is possible to filter SYSLOG messages to be forwarded to the host using a match or match-string condition. This should not be set for the device's the Remote SYSLOG Host/s configured in meeting this Recommendation.

Impact:
Network Devices, particularly Firewalls, can generate a significant volumes of log data, it is essential that the target SYSLOG server is suitably resourced to handle the expected volume of messages and it is strongly recommended that robust archiving and retention processes be employed.

This information can provide a record of activity on the JUNOS Device when responding to both Security Incidents and Operational Issues.
A local SYSLOG file should be configured to record all Authentication and Authorization related events, which are both generated by the authorization facility."
  solution    : "To configure a local SYSLOG file for Auth events, issue the following command from the [edit system syslog] hierarchy;
[edit system syslog]
user@host#set file <filename> authorization any

Impact:
Authentication and Authorization events will be logged to the configured file in the JUNOS Device's /var/log/ folder. You may wish to specify the size of files to be recorded, the number of zipped older files the JUNOS Devices should keep and automatic archiving settings to appropriate values for the device and environment you are using.

Rationale:
When responding to a security incident or fault, a record of all of the commands issued on the JUNOS Devices, either through the CLI or through management APIs such as JUNOScript or NETCONF, can provide vital clues.
A local SYSLOG file should be configured to record all interactive-commands issued on the JUNOS Device, along with details of the user who issued them and when. Having this data available locally, as well as on remote SYSLOG or SIEM Servers, can aide Incident Responders and enable a faster resolution to both Security and Operational related issues."

  info            : "Logging data should be saved locally to the default messages file.

Rationale:
As part of the factory-default configuration, all JUNOS devices are configured to log SYSLOG events from several Facilities to a standard /var/log/messages file.
The exact logging for this file may vary slightly by platform, but will always include critical messages from any facility and authorization messages at info level.
When responding to a Security Incident, it is not uncommon for additional external resources or JTAC support to be engaged. Removing logging to this standard location may slow down and hamper Incident Responders, particularly those who may not be familiar with organization specific standards, as they look for expected logs in this file, either manually or using automated/scripting tools.
The fact that the /var/log/messages file is missing may also be interpreted by Incident Responders as being a part of the intrusion or incident, resulting in further time being lost investigating something which is not, in this case, related to the incident.
For these reasons, the default logging to the /var/log/messages file should always be left in place on all JUNOS Devices, with any additional details or levels logged to other files as required."
  solution        : "To configure a local SYSLOG messages file, issue the following commands from the [edit system syslog] hierarchy;
[edit system syslog]
user@host#set file messages any critical

[edit system syslog]
user@host#set file messages authorization info
On some JUNOS platforms, the factory-default configuration may include additional elements to be logged to the /var/log/messages file.
You can confirm what the factory-default settings for SYSLOG are on your JUNOS Device by issuing the following commands from a new configuration mode session - which does not have any outstanding changes.
First, confirm that there are no pending changes:
[edit]
user@host# show | compare
If any difference were highlighted do not proceed with the next set of commands until you have either rolled back or committed the outstanding changes.
Next load the factory-default configuration (do not commit this configuration):
[edit]
user@host# load factory-default
Now we can compare the factory-default configuration to your current Active Configuration (rollback 0):
[edit]
user@host# edit system syslog file messages

[edit system syslog file messages]
user@host# show | compare
Finally, roll the Candidate Configuration back to the current Active Configuration and quit from Configuration Mode:
[edit system syslog file messages]
user@host# top

[edit]
user@host# rollback 0
load complete

[edit]
user@host# quit
Any logging which was missing from the current Active Configuration should be added to restore the original configuration.

Impact:
The default local logging to the /var/log/messages file will be used.

Default Value:
Messages from any Facility at critical Severity and from the authorization Facility at info Severity are logged to the /var/log/messages file on all JUNOS Devices. Some devices may have additional logging to this file by default."

  description : "6.13 Ensure Autoinstallation is Set to Disabled"
  info        : "Autoinstallation should be disabled.

Rationale:
The Autoinstallation feature allows the JUNOS Device to automatically download and apply configuration from an FTP, TFTP or HTTP server on boot, having obtained IP Address details via DHCP or BOOTP.
Autoinstallation provides an extremely useful function for rapid deployment of large numbers of devices, however Autoinstallation provides no method to authenticate the identity of the Installation Servers or validity of the supplied configuration files.
This may allow an attacker to change the device's configuration at boot (or after forcing a reboot through a DoS attack) by impersonating the DHCP, FTP, TFTP or HTTP servers or by carrying out session hijacking. This would be a multistage attack, as Autoinstallation should only be used if the device does not find an existing configuration locally - so the attacker would also need to have been able to disrupt the configuration or boot process through some other vector, but this may be viable for an attacker who already has some foothold on the device to escalate their privileges.
If successful the attacker would have gained complete control over the JUNOS Device.
Because all of the protocols used by Autoinstallation transfer data in plain text, it is trivial for an attacker to intercept the traffic and obtain a complete copy of the configuration, possibly containing authentication details to both the device and Operational Support Services.
Autoinstallation is useful during deployments of large number of devices, but due to these limitations should only be used in a tightly controlled, isolated, build environment where the authenticity of servers and configuration can be assured and snooping on sensitive details can be eliminated. Autoinstallation should never be used over untrusted or public networks, such as over the Internet.
Many JUNOS Devices have Autoinstallation enabled by default to support large deployments using the feature, but Autoinstallation should be disabled on all devices once deployed to production."
  solution    : "To disable Autoinstallation issue the following command from the [edit system] hierarchy;
[edit system]
user@host#delete autoinstallation

Impact:
This should have no impact on production systems, as Autoinstallation should only be used when no non-factory-default configuration is present on the JUNOS Device at boot.

The first step in any attack is reconnaissance. An attacker will attempt to learn about the target network, its hosts and network devices.
A key piece of information for an attacker is what type of device he/she is attacking. By using the routers Model number, type, manufacturer or software version as part of its hostname, we give an attacker this valuable piece of information with no effort or risk of exposure. This is particularly true where the hostname is used in DNS.
This should not be interpreted as recommending 'security through obscurity' as a valid approach - rather that, as defenders, we would rather an attacker be required to perform more active reconnaissance to gather information about the target network - so that Intrusion Prevention Systems, Firewalls, Honeypots and other Security solutions are given a greater opportunity to detect and defend against the activity."
