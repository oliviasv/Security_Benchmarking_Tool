In distributed information systems, authorization processes and access control decisions may occur in separate parts of the systems.

To support the access control decisions, it may be necessary to transmit, as part of the access authorization information, supporting security attributes.

Currently, HMAC is the only FIPS-approved algorithm for generating and verifying message/data authentication codes in accordance with FIPS 198-1. Products that are FIPS 140-2 validated will have an HMAC that meets specification; however, the option must be configured for use as the only message authentication code used for authentication to cryptographic modules.

Separate requirements for configuring applications and protocols used by each application (e.g., SNMPv3, SSHv2, NTP, HTTPS, and other protocols and applications that require server/client authentication) are required to implement this requirement.

Upon detecting a failure of any router components, the router must activate a system alert message, send an alarm, or shut down. By immediately displaying an alarm message, potential security violations can be identified more quickly even when administrators are not logged into the device. This can be facilitated by the router sending SNMP traps to the SNMP manager that can then have the necessary action taken by automatic or operator intervention."
