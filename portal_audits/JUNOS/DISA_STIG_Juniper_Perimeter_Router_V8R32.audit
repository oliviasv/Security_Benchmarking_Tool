Option A

You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided for USG-authorized use only.

By using this IS (which includes any device attached to this IS), you consent to the following conditions:

-The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS for purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations.

-At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.

-Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose.

-This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) to protect USG interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy.

-Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to PM, LE or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged communications, or work product, related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants. Such communications and work product are private and confidential. See User Agreement for details.

Option B

If the system is incapable of displaying the required banner verbiage due to its size, a smaller banner must be used. The mandatory verbiage follows: 'I've read & consent to terms in IS user agreem't.''"

  description : "NET0966 - Control plane protection is not enabled."
  info        : "The Route Processor (RP) is critical to all network operations as it is the component used to build all forwarding paths for the data plane via control plane processes. It is also instrumental with ongoing network management functions that keep the routers and links available for providing network services. Hence, any disruption to the RP or the control and management planes can result in mission critical network outages.

In addition to control plane and management plane traffic that is in the router's receive path, the RP must also handle other traffic that must be punted to the RP - that is, the traffic must be fast or process switched. This is the result of packets that must be fragmented, require an ICMP response (TTL expiration, unreachable, etc.) have IP options, etc. A DoS attack targeting the RP can be perpetrated either inadvertently or maliciously involving high rates of punted traffic resulting in excessive RP CPU and memory utilization. To maintain network stability, the router must be able to securely handle specific control plane and management plane traffic that is destined to it, as well as other punted traffic.

Using the ingress filter on forwarding interfaces is a method that has been used in the past to filter both forwarding path and receiving path traffic. However, this method does not scale well as the number of interfaces grows and the size of the ingress filters grow. Control plane policing can be used to increase security of routers and multilayer switches by protecting the RP from unnecessary or malicious traffic. Filtering and rate limiting the traffic flow of control plane packets can be implemented to protect routers against reconnaissance and DoS attacks allowing the control plane to maintain packet forwarding and protocol states despite an attack or heavy load on the router or multilayer switch.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

  description : "NET1970 - Ensure that the router or firewall software has been upgraded to mitigate the risk of DNS cache poisoning attack."
  info        : "DNS cache poisoning is an attack technique that allows an attacker to introduce forged DNS information into the cache of a caching name server. There are inherent deficiencies in the DNS protocol and defects in implementations that facilitate DNS cache poisoning.
Name servers vulnerable to cache poisoning attacks are due to their use of insufficiently randomized transaction IDs and UDP source ports in the DNS queries that they produce, which may allow an attacker to more easily forge DNS answers that can poison DNS caches. To exploit these vulnerabilities an attacker must be able to cause a vulnerable DNS server to perform recursive DNS queries. Therefore, DNS servers that are only authoritative, or servers where recursion is not allowed, are not affected.

The DNS protocol specification includes a transaction ID field of 16 bits. If the specification is correctly implemented and the transaction ID is randomly selected with a strong random number generator, an attacker will require, on average, 32,768 attempts to successfully predict the ID. Some flawed implementations may use a smaller number of bits for this transaction ID, meaning that fewer attempts will be needed. Furthermore, there are known errors with the randomness of transaction IDs that are generated by a number of implementations.

Some current implementations allocate an arbitrary source port at startup (and sometimes selected at random) and reuse this source port for all outgoing queries. With other implementations, the source port for outgoing queries is fixed at the traditional assigned DNS server UDP port number 53. Because attacks against these vulnerabilities all rely on an attacker's ability to predict, the implementation of per-query source port randomization in the server presents a practical mitigation against these attacks within the boundaries of the current protocol specification. Randomized source ports can be used to gain approximately 16 additional bits of randomness in the data that an attacker must guess. Randomizing the ports adds a significant amount of attack resiliency.

Routers, firewalls, proxies, and other gateway devices that perform NAT'more specifically Port Address Translation (PAT)'often rewrite source ports in order to track connection state. A flawed implementation of a PAT device using a predictiable source port allocation method can reduce any effectiveness of source port randomization implemented by name servers and stub resolvers. Henceforth, it is imperative that the router or firewall software has been upgraded or patched to reduce an attacker's opportunity for launching a DNS cache poisoning attack.

Note: Regular NAT (allocating one public IP address for each private IP address) is not affected by this problem because it only rewrites layer 3 information and does not modify layer 4 header information of packets traversing the NAT device."

<report type:"WARNING">
  description : "NET-IPV6-017 - The network element must be configured to ensure the routing header extension type 0, 1, and 3-255 are rejected."
  info        : "The Routing header is used by an IPv6 source to specify a list of intermediate nodes that a packet has to traverse on the path to its destination.  If the packet cannot take the path, it is returned to the source node in an ICMPv6 unreachable error message.  This header supports a function very similar to the IPv4 packet Loose Source Routing.  The routing header can be used maliciously to send a packet through a path where less robust security is in place, than through the presumably preferred path by routing protocols. Use of the routing extension header has few legitimate uses other than as implemented by Mobile IPv6.  The Routing header is identified by a Next Header value of 43 and should be filtered by type using an ACL.

The Type 0 Routing Header (RFC 5095) is dangerous because it allows attackers to spoof source addresses and get traffic in response, rather than to the real owner of the address. Secondly, a packet with an allowed destination address could be sent through a Firewall only to bounce to a different node once inside using the Routing Header functionality. If the Type 0 Routing Header must be used, it must be used in conjunction with either the IPsec AH or the IPsec Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP) headers.  The Routing Header is identified by a Next Header value of 43 (0x2B) and can be filtered by type using an ACL similar to: deny ipv6 any routing-type 0 log.

The Type 1 Routing Header is defined by an abandoned specification called 'Nimrod Routing'. Assuming that most implementations will not recognize the Type 1 Routing Header, it must be dropped. When IETF standards explicitly require nodes to gracefully rejected invalid or deprecated options, in the case of Routing Headers, however, under certain conditions the specification allows a node to 'ignore the Routing Header and proceed to the next header in the packet' [RFC 2460, section 4.4 para 2]. This allows a spurious data channel of arbitrary size and must not be allowed.

The Type 3 through 255 Routing Header values in the routing type field are currently undefined and should also be dropped inbound and outbound. The Routing Header is identified by a Next Header value of 43 (0x2B). To drop all types including type 2 Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) a filter can be defined to drop the Routing Header 43 (0x2B). If MIPv6 is required a permit will be required for Routing Header 43 (0x2B) Type 2, and then drop the remaining Routing Headers 43 (0x2B).

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

  info        : "Network Address Translation with Protocol Translation (NAT-PT), defined in [RFC2766], is a service that can be used to translate data sent between IP-heterogeneous nodes. NAT-PT translates IPv4 datagrams into a semantically equivalent IPv6 datagram or vice versa. For this service to work it has to be located in the connection point between the IPv4 network and the IPv6 network. The PT-part of the NAT-PT handles the interpretation and translation of the semantically equivalent IP header, either from IPv4 to IPv6 or from IPv6 to IPv4. Like NAT, NATPT also uses a pool of addresses which it dynamically assigns to the translated datagrams.

The NAT-PT architecture is not one of the preferred DoD IPv6 transition paradigms due to the deprecation of NAT-PT within the DoD community.

The following sub-sections provide guidelines for the use of NAT-PT within a controlled enclave.

In addition to the single point of failure, the reduced performance of an application level gateway, coupled with limitations on the kinds of applications that work, decreases the overall value and utility of the network. NAT-PT also inhibits the ability to deploy security at the IP layer.

  info        : "An automatic 6to4 tunnel allows isolated IPv6 domains to be connected over an IPv4 network and allows connections to remote IPv6 networks. The key difference between this deployment and manually configured tunnels is that the routers are not configured in pairs and thus do not require manual configuration because they treat the IPv4 infrastructure as a virtual non-broadcast link, using an IPv4 address embedded in the IPv6 address to find the remote end of the tunnel. In other words, the tunnel destination is determined by the IPv4 address of the external interface of the 6to4 router that is concatenated to the 2002::/16 prefix in the format 2002: V4ADDR::/48.  Hence, the imbedded V4ADDR of the 6to4 prefix must belong to the same ipv4 prefix as configured on the external-facing interface of the 6to4 router.

  description : "NET-TUNL-013 - L2TP must not pass into the private network of an enclave."
  info        : "Unlike GRE (a simple encapsulating header) L2TP is a full-fledged communications protocol with control channel, data channels, and a robust command structure. In addition to PPP, other link layer types (called pseudowires) can be and are defined for delivery in L2TP by separate RFC documents. Further complexity is created by the capability to define vender-specific parameters beyond those defined in the L2TP specifications.

The endpoint devices of an L2TP connection can be an L2TP Access Concentrator (LAC) in which case it inputs/outputs the layer 2 protocol to/from the L2TP tunnel. Otherwise it is an L2TP Network Server (LNS), in which case it inputs/outputs the layer 3 (IP) protocol to/from the L2TP tunnel. The specifications describe three reference models: LAC-LNS, LAC-LAC, and LNS-LNS, the first of which is the most common case. The LAC-LNS model allows a remote access user to reach his home network or ISP from a remote location. The remote access user either dials (or otherwise connects via layer 2) to a LAC device which tunnels his connection home to an awaiting LNS. The LAC could also be located on the remote user's laptop which connects to an LNS at home using some generic internet connection. The other reference models may be used for more obscure scenarios.

Although the L2TP protocol does not contain encryption capability, it can be operated over IPSEC which would provide authentication and confidentiality. A remote user in the LAC-LNS model would most likely obtain a dynamically assigned IP address from the home network to ultimately use through the tunnel back to the home network. Secondly, the outer IP source address used to send the L2TP tunnel packet to the home network is likely to be unknown or highly variable. Thirdly, since the LNS provides the remote user with a dynamic IP address to use, the firewall at the home network would have to be dynamically updated to accept this address in conjunction with the outer tunnel address. Finally, there is also the issue of authentication of the remote user prior to divulging an acceptable IP address. As a result of all of these complications, the strict filtering rules applied to the IP-in-IP and GRE tunneling cases will likely not be possible in the L2TP scenario.

In addition to the difficulty of enforcing addresses and endpoints (as explained above), the L2TP protocol itself is a security concern if allowed through a security boundary. In particular:

1) L2TP potentially allows link layer protocols to be delivered from afar. These protocols were intended for link-local scope only, are less defended, and not as well-known
2) The L2TP tunnels can carry IP packets that are very difficult to see and filter because of the additional layer 2 overhead
3) L2TP is highly complex and variable (vender-specific variability) and therefore would be a viable target that is difficult to defend. It is better left outside of the main firewall where less damage occurs if the L2TP-processing node is compromised.
4) Filtering cannot be used to detect and prevent other unintended layer 2 protocols from being tunneled. The strength of the application layer code would have to be relied on to achieve this task.
5) Regardless of whether the L2TP is handled inside or outside of the main network, a secondary layer of IP filtering is required, therefore bringing it inside doesn't save resources.

Therefore, it is not recommended to allow unencrypted L2TP packets across the security boundary into the network's protected areas. Reference the Backbone Transport STIG for additional L2TP guidance and use.

  description : "NET-TUNL-017 - ISATAP tunnels must terminate at an interior router."
  info        : "ISATAP is an automatic tunnel mechanism that does not provide authentication such as IPSec.  As a result of this limitation, ISATAP is thought of as a tool that is used inside the enclave among trusted hosts, which would limit it to internal attacks.  ISATAP is a service versus a product, and is readily available to most users.  If a user knows the ISATAP router IP address, they can essentially get onto the IPv6 intranet.  To control the vulnerability of this tunnel mechanism, it is critical to control the use of protocol 41 and use IPv4 filters to control what IPv4 nodes can send protocol 41 packets to an ISATAP router interface.  Although the ISATAP tunneling mechanism is similar to other automatic tunneling mechanisms, such as IPv6 6to4 tunneling, ISATAP is designed for transporting IPv6 packets between sites within an enclave, not between enclaves.

  NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
