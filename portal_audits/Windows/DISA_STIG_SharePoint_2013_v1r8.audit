Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their application session prior to vacating the vicinity, applications need to be able to identify when a user's application session has idled and take action to initiate the session lock.

The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be determined and/or controlled. This is typically at the operating system level and results in a system lock, but it may be at the application level, where the application interface window is secured instead. The organization defines the period of inactivity that shall pass before a session lock is initiated, so this must be configurable."

  description : "SP13-00-000030 - SharePoint must enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information between interconnected systems in accordance with applicable policy."
  info        : "Information flow control regulates where information is allowed to travel within an information system and between information systems (as opposed to who is allowed to access the information) and without explicit regard to subsequent accesses to that information.

From an application perspective, flow control is established once application data flow modeling has been completed. Data flow modeling can be described as the process of identifying, modeling, and documenting how data moves around an information system. Data flow modeling examines processes (activities that transform data from one form to another), data stores (the holding areas for data), external entities (what sends data into a system or receives data from a system), and data flows (routes by which data can flow).

Once the application data flows have been identified, corresponding flow controls can be applied at the appropriate points.

A few examples of flow control restrictions include the following: keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet and blocking information that is marked as classified but is being transported to an unapproved destination. Information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms are commonly employed by organizations to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, devices) within information systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path.

Application-specific examples of flow control enforcement can be found in information protection software (e.g., guards, proxies, gateways, and cross domain solutions) employing rule sets or establishing configuration settings restricting information system services or providing message-filtering capability based on content (e.g., using key word searches or document characteristics).

Applications providing information flow control must be able to enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information between interconnected systems in accordance with applicable policy.

SharePoint Central Administrator is a powerful management tool used to administer the farm. This server should be installed on a trusted network segment. This server should be used to run required services rather than user-oriented web applications.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

These connections will typically originate over either the public Internet or the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).

Numerous best practices are employed to protect remote connections, such as utilizing encryption to protect data sessions and firewalls to restrict and control network connectivity. In addition to these protections, auditing must also be utilized in order to track system activity, assist in diagnosing system issues and provide evidence needed for forensic investigations post security incident.

When organizations define security-related application functions or security-related application information, it is incumbent upon the application providing access to that data to ensure auditing of remote connectivity to those resources occurs in support of organizational requirements.

Examples of remote access methods include dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

Remote network and system access is accomplished by leveraging common communication protocols to establish a remote connection. These connections will typically originate over either the public Internet or the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). Neither of these Internetworking mechanisms is private or secure, and they do not, by default, restrict access to networked resources once connectivity is established.

Numerous best practices are employed to protect remote connections, such as utilizing encryption to protect data sessions and firewalls to restrict and control network connectivity. In addition to these protections, auditing must also be utilized in order to track system activity, assist in diagnosing system issues and provide evidence needed for forensic investigations post security incident.

When organizations define security-related application functions or security-related application information, it is incumbent upon the application providing access to that data to ensure auditing of remote connectivity to those resources occurs in support of organizational requirements.

Remote access to security functions (e.g., user management, audit log management, etc.) and security-relevant information requires the activity be audited by the organization. Any application providing remote access must support organizational requirements to audit access or organization-defined security functions and security-relevant information."

Information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms are commonly employed by organizations to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., users, networks, devices) within information systems and between interconnected systems.

Application-specific examples of flow control enforcement can be found in information protection software (e.g., guards, proxies, application layer gateways, and cross domain solutions) employing rule sets or establishing configuration settings restricting information system services or providing message-filtering capability based on content (e.g., using key word searches or document characteristics).

Mobile code technologies include, for example, Java, JavaScript, ActiveX, PDF, Postscript, Shockwave movies, Flash animations, and VBScript. Usage restrictions and implementation guidance apply to both the selection and use of mobile code installed on organizational servers and mobile code downloaded and executed on individual workstations.

Applications can prevent the execution of prohibited mobile code by leveraging architectures that provide a virtual execution environment sometimes referred to as a 'sandbox'. The mobile code is executed within this isolated environment apart from the host's indigenous operating environment that allows for mobile code capability restrictions and helps to prevent malicious code from accessing system resources and data.
