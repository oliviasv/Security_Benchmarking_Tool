Conversely, if a reasonable time value is configured for this policy setting, users would be locked out for a set period until all of the accounts are unlocked automatically. Users can accidentally lock themselves out of their accounts if they mistype their password multiple times.

      info           : "This policy setting determines the number of failed logon attempts before a lock occurs. Authorized users can lock themselves out of an account by mistyping their password or by remembering it incorrectly, or by changing their password on one computer while logged on to another computer. The computer with the incorrect password will continuously try to authenticate the user, and because the password it uses to authenticate is incorrect, a lock occurs. To avoid accidental lockout of authorized users, set the account lockout threshold to a high number. The default value for this policy setting is 0 invalid logon attempts, which disables the account lockout feature. Because it is possible for an attacker to use this lockout state as a denial of service (DoS) by triggering a lockout on a large number of accounts, your organization should determine whether to use this policy setting based on identified threats and the risks you want to mitigate. There are two options to consider for this policy setting. #x2022; Configure the value for Account lockout threshold to 0 to ensure that accounts will not be locked out. This setting value will prevent a DoS attack that attempts to lock out accounts in your organization. It will also reduce help desk calls, because users will not be able to lock themselves out of their accounts accidentally. However, this setting value will not prevent a brute force attack. The following defenses should also be considered: #x2022; A password policy that forces all users to have complex passwords made up of 8 or more characters. #x2022; A robust auditing mechanism, which will alert administrators when a series of account lockouts occurs in the environment. For example, the auditing solution should monitor for security event 539, which is a logon failure. This event identifies that there was a lock on the account at the time of the logon attempt. The second option is: #x2022; Configure the value for Account lockout threshold to a value that provides users with the ability to mistype their password several times, but locks out the account if a brute force password attack occurs. This configuration will prevent accidental account lockouts and reduce help desk calls, but will not prevent a DoS attack. Password attacks can use automated methods to try millions of password combinations for any user account. The effectiveness of such attacks can be almost eliminated if you limit the number of failed logons that can be performed. However, a denial of service (DoS) attack could be performed on a domain that has an account lockout threshold configured. An attacker could programmatically attempt a series of password attacks against all users in the organization. If the number of attempts is greater than the account lockout threshold, the attacker might be able to lock out every account."
      solution       : "Navigate to the Group Policy UI path expressed in the Audit procedure and set Account lockout threshold as recommended.

Impact- If this policy setting is enabled, a locked-out account will not be usable until it is reset by an administrator or until the account lockout duration expires. This setting will likely generate a number of additional help desk calls. In fact, locked accounts cause the greatest number of calls to the help desk in many organizations. If you enforce this setting an attacker could cause a denial of service condition by deliberately generating failed logons for multiple user, therefore you should also configure the Account Lockout Duration to a relatively low value such as 15 minutes. If you configure the Account Lockout Threshold to 0, there is a possibility that an attacker's attempt to discover passwords with a brute force password attack might go undetected if a robust audit mechanism is not in place."

If you set the value to 0, the password will never expire. The default value for this policy setting is 42 days. Because attackers can crack passwords, the more frequently you change the password the less opportunity an attacker has to use a cracked password. However, the lower this value is set, the higher the potential for an increase in calls to help desk support due to users having to change their password or forgetting which password is current. The longer a password exists the higher the likelihood that it will be compromised by a brute force attack, by an attacker gaining general knowledge about the user, or by the user sharing the password. Configuring the Maximum password age setting to 0 so that users are never required to change their passwords is a major security risk because that allows a compromised password to be used by the malicious user for as long as the valid user is authorized access."
      solution        : "Navigate to the Group Policy UI path expressed in the Audit procedure and set Maximum password age as recommended.

Impact- If the Maximum password age setting is too low, users are required to change their passwords very often. Such a configuration can reduce security in the organization, because users might write their passwords in an insecure location or lose them. If the value for this policy setting is too high, the level of security within an organization is reduced because it allows potential attackers more time in which to discover user passwords or to use compromised accounts."

The value for this policy setting must be between 0 and 24 passwords. The default value for Windows Vista is 0 passwords, but the default setting in a domain is 24 passwords. To maintain the effectiveness of this policy setting, use the Minimum password age setting to prevent users from repeatedly changing their password. The longer a user uses the same password, the greater the chance that an attacker can determine the password through brute force attacks. Also, any accounts that may have been compromised will remain exploitable for as long as the password is left unchanged. If password changes are required but password reuse is not prevented, or if users continually reuse a small number of passwords, the effectiveness of a good password policy is greatly reduced. If you specify a low number for this policy setting, users will be able to use the same small number of passwords repeatedly. If you do not also configure the Minimum password age setting, users might repeatedly change their passwords until they can reuse their original password."
      solution        : "Navigate to the Group Policy UI path expressed in the Audit procedure and set Enforce password history as recommended.

Impact- The major impact of this configuration is that users must create a new password every time they are required to change their old one. If users are required to change their passwords to new unique values, there is an increased risk of users who write their passwords somewhere so that they do not forget them. Another risk is that users may create passwords that change incrementally (for example, password01, password02, and so on) to facilitate memorization but make them easier to guess. Also, an excessively low value for the Minimum password age setting will likely increase administrative overhead, because users who forget their passwords might ask the help desk to reset them frequently."

Impact- If your organization uses either the CHAP authentication protocol through remote access or IAS services or Digest Authentication in IIS, you must configure this policy setting to Enabled.

Users may have favorite passwords that they like to use because they are easy to remember and they believe that their password choice is secure from compromise. Unfortunately, passwords are compromised and if an attacker is targeting a specific individual user account, with foreknowledge of data about that user, reuse of old passwords can cause a security breach. To address password reuse a combination of security settings is required. Using this policy setting with the Enforce password history setting prevents the easy reuse of old passwords. For example, if you configure the Enforce password history setting to ensure that users cannot reuse any of their last 12 passwords, they could change their password 13 times in a few minutes and reuse the password they started with, unless you also configure the Minimum password age setting to a number that is greater than 0.

      info            : "This policy setting checks all new passwords to ensure that they meet basic requirements for strong passwords. When this policy is enabled, passwords must meet the following minimum requirements: #x2022; Not contain the user's account name or parts of the user's full name that exceed two consecutive characters #x2022; Be at least six characters in length #x2022; Contain characters from three of the following four categories: #x2022; English uppercase characters (A through Z) #x2022; English lowercase characters (a through z) #x2022; Base 10 digits (0 through 9) #x2022; Non-alphabetic characters (for example, !, $, #, %) #x2022; A catch-all category of any Unicode character that does not fall under the previous four categories. This fifth category can be regionally specific. Each additional character in a password increases its complexity exponentially. For instance, a seven-character, all lower-case alphabetic password would have 267 (approximately 8 x 109 or 8 billion) possible combinations. At 1,000,000 attempts per second (a capability of many password-cracking utilities), it would only take 133 minutes to crack. A seven-character alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 527 combinations. A seven-character case-sensitive alphanumeric password without punctuation has 627 combinations. An eight-character password has 268 (or 2 x 1011) possible combinations. Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords. Remember, these times will significantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and other special keyboard characters such as '!' or '@'. Proper use of the password settings can help make it difficult to mount a brute force attack. Passwords that contain only alphanumeric characters are extremely easy to discover with several publicly available tools."
      solution        : "Navigate to the Group Policy UI path expressed in the Audit procedure and set Password must meet complexity requirements as recommended.

Impact- If the default password complexity configuration is retained, additional help desk calls for locked-out accounts could occur because users might not be accustomed to passwords that contain non-alphabetic characters. However, all users should be able to comply with the complexity requirement with minimal difficulty. If your organization has more stringent security requirements, you can create a custom version of the Passfilt.dll file that allows the use of arbitrarily complex password strength rules. For example, a custom password filter might require the use of non-upper row characters. (Upper row characters are those that require you to hold down the SHIFT key and press any of the digits between 1 and 0.) A custom password filter might also perform a dictionary check to verify that the proposed password does not contain common dictionary words or fragments. Also, the use of ALT key character combinations can greatly enhance the complexity of a password. However, such stringent password requirements can result in unhappy users and an extremely busy help desk. Alternatively, your organization could consider a requirement for all administrator passwords to use ALT characters in the 0128#x00E2;#x20AC;#x201C;0159 range.

      info            : "This policy setting determines the least number of characters that make up a password for a user account. There are many different theories about how to determine the best password length for an organization, but perhaps 'pass phrase' is a better term than 'password.' In Microsoft Windows 2000 or later, pass phrases can be quite long and can include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as 'I want to drink a $5 milkshake' is a valid pass phrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string of random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated about the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially with regard to password length. In enterprise environments, ensure that the value for the Minimum password length setting is configured to 8 characters. This policy setting is long enough to provide adequate security. In high security environments, configure the value to 12 characters. Types of password attacks include dictionary attacks (which attempt to use common words and phrases) and brute force attacks (which try every possible combination of characters). Also, attackers sometimes try to obtain the account database so they can use tools to discover the accounts and passwords."
      solution        : "Navigate to the Group Policy UI path expressed in the Audit procedure and set Minimum password length as recommended.

Impact- Requirements for extremely long passwords can actually decrease the security of an organization, because users might leave the information in an insecure location or lose it. If very long passwords are required, mistyped passwords could cause account lockouts and increase the volume of help desk calls. If your organization has issues with forgotten passwords due to password length requirements, consider teaching your users about pass phrases, which are often easier to remember and, due to the larger number of character combinations, much harder to discover. Note- Older versions of Windows such as Windows 98 and Windows NT#x00AE; 4.0 do not support passwords that are longer than 14 characters. Computers that run these older operating systems are unable to authenticate with computers or domains that use accounts that require long passwords."

Therefore, you may want to disable the built-in Administrator account instead of relying on regular password changes to protect it from attack.

      info        : "LAN Manager (LM) is a family of early Microsoft client/server software that allows users to link personal computers together on a single network. Network capabilities include transparent file and print sharing, user security features, and network administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is the default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 (NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients when they perform the following operations: . Join a domain . Authenticate between Active Directory forests . Authenticate to down-level domains . Authenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, or Windows XP) . Authenticate to computers that are not in the domain The possible values for the Network security: LAN Manager authentication level setting are: . Send LM & NTLM responses . Send LM & NTLM use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated . Send NTLM responses only . Send NTLMv2 responses only . Send NTLMv2 responses only\refuse LM . Send NTLMv2 responses only\refuse LM & NTLM . Not Defined The Network security: LAN Manager authentication level setting determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice affects the authentication protocol level that clients use, the session security level that the computers negotiate, and the authentication level that servers accept as follows: . Send LM & NTLM responses. Clients use LM and NTLM authentication and never use NTLMv2 session security. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Send LM & NTLM use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated. Clients use LM and NTLM authentication and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Send NTLM response only. Clients use NTLM authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Send NTLMv2 response only. Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Send NTLMv2 response only\refuse LM. Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM (accept only NTLM and NTLMv2 authentication). . Send NTLMv2 response only\refuse LM & NTLM. Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM and NTLM (accept only NTLMv2 authentication). These settings correspond to the levels discussed in other Microsoft documents as follows: . Level 0 Send LM and NTLM response; never use NTLMv2 session security. Clients use LM and NTLM authentication, and never use NTLMv2 session security. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Level 1 Use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated. Clients use LM and NTLM authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Level 2 Send NTLM response only. Clients use only NTLM authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Level 3 Send NTLMv2 response only. Clients use NTLMv2 authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Level 4 Domain controllers refuse LM responses. Clients use NTLM authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM authentication, that is, they accept NTLM and NTLMv2. . Level 5 Domain controllers refuse LM and NTLM responses (accept only NTLMv2). Clients use NTLMv2 authentication, use and NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse NTLM and LM authentication (they accept only NTLMv2). In Windows Vista, this setting is undefined. However, in Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP clients are configured by default to send LM and NTLM authentication responses (Windows 95-based and Windows 98-based clients only send LM). The default setting on servers allows all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resources. However, this means that LM responses the weakest form of authentication response are sent over the network, and it is potentially possible for attackers to sniff that traffic to more easily reproduce the user's password. The Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems cannot use the Kerberos version 5 protocol for authentication. For this reason, in a Windows Server 2003 domain, these computers authenticate by default with both the LM and NTLM protocols for network authentication. You can enforce a more secure authentication protocol for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the logon process, NTLMv2 uses a secure channel to protect the authentication process. Even if you use NTLMv2 for earlier clients and servers, Windows-based clients and servers that are members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to authenticate with Windows Server 2003 domain controllers."

Modifying these ACLs from the default may cause some applications to components that communicate by using DCOM to fail. If you implement a COM server and you override the default security settings, confirm that the application-specific launch permissions ACL assigns activation permission to appropriate users. If it does not, you need to change your application-specific launch permission ACL to provide appropriate users with activation rights so that applications and Windows components that use DCOM do not fail."

The POSIX subsystem is an Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) standard that defines a set of operating system services. The POSIX subsystem is required if the server supports applications that use that subsystem. The POSIX subsystem introduces a security risk that relates to processes that can potentially persist across logons. If a user starts a process and then logs out, there is a potential that the next user who logs on to the computer could access the previous user's process. This potential is dangerous, because anything the second user does with that process will be performed with the privileges of the first user."

If you enable this policy setting, the Microsoft network client computer cannot communicate with a Microsoft network server unless that server agrees to sign SMB packets. In mixed environments with legacy client computers, set this option to Disabled because these computers will not be able to authenticate or gain access to domain controllers. However, you can use this policy setting in Windows 2000 or later environments. Note When Windows Vistabased computers have this policy setting enabled and they connect to file or print shares on remote servers, it is important that the setting is synchronized with its companion setting, Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always), on those servers. For more information about these settings, see the Microsoft network client and server: Digitally sign communications (four related settings) section in Chapter 5 of the Threats and Countermeasures guide. Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network as the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can potentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then forward themso that the server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the attacker could pose as the server or client after legitimate authentication and gain unauthorized access to data. SMB is the resource sharing protocol that is supported by the Windows operating systems. SMB signatures authenticate both users and the servers that host the data. If either side fails the authentication process, data transmission will not take place."
      solution    : "To implement the recommended configuration state, set the following Group Policy setting to 1.

Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security Options\Microsoft network client- Digitally sign communications (always)

Impact- The Windows 2000 and later implementations of the SMB file and print sharing protocol support mutual authentication, which protect against session hijacking attacks and support message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then verified by both the client and the server. Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server that is serving as a domain controller, file server, print server, and application server performance may be substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB communications, older applications and operating systems will not be able to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks. When SMB signing policies are enabled on domain controllers running Windows Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows Server 2008 group policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available from Microsoft that resolves this issue; see Microsoft Knowledgebase Article 950876 for more details- http-//support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/950876/."

The implementation of digital signing in Windowsbased networks helps to prevent sessions from being hijacked. If you enable this policy setting, the Microsoft network client will use signing only if the server with which it communicates accepts digitally signed communication. Microsoft recommends to enable The Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (if server agrees) setting. Note Enabling this policy setting on SMB clients on your network makes them fully effective for packet signing with all clients and servers in your environment. Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network as the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can potentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then them so that the server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the attacker could pose as the server or client after legitimate authentication and gain unauthorized access to data. SMB is the resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows operating systems. SMB signatures authenticate both users and the servers that host the data. If either side fails the authentication process, data transmission will not take place."
      solution    : "To implement the recommended configuration state, set the following Group Policy setting to 1.

Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security Options\Microsoft network client- Digitally sign communications (if server agrees)

Impact- The Windows 2000 and later implementations of the SMB file and print sharing protocol support mutual authentication, which protect against session hijacking attacks and support message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then verified by both the client and the server. Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server that is serving as a domain controller, file server, print server, and application server performance may be substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB communications, older applications and operating systems will not be able to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks. When SMB signing policies are enabled on domain controllers running Windows Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows Server 2008 group policy processing will fail.

If a system is set to always encrypt or sign secure channel data, it cannot establish a secure channel with a domain controller that is not capable of signing or encrypting all secure channel traffic, because all secure channel data must be signed and encrypted. Microsoft recommends to configure the Domain member: Digitally encrypt or sign secure channel data (always) setting to Enabled. When a computer joins a domain, a computer account is created.

Impact- Digital encryption and signing of the secure channel is a good idea where it is supported. The secure channel protects domain credentials as they are sent to the domain controller. However, only Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 6a (SP6a) and subsequent versions of the Windows operating system support digital encryption and signing of the secure channel. Windows 98 Second Edition clients do not support it unless they have the Dsclient installed. Therefore, you cannot enable the Domain member- Digitally encrypt or sign secure channel data (always) setting on domain controllers that support Windows 98 clients as members of the domain.

      info        : "This policy setting determines if the server side SMB service is required to perform SMB packet signing. Enable this policy setting in a mixed environment to prevent downstream clients from using the workstation as a network server. Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network as the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can potentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then modify the traffic and forward it so that the server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the attacker could pose as the server or client after legitimate authentication and gain unauthorized access to data. SMB is the resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows operating systems.SMB signatures authenticate both users and the servers that host the data. If either side fails the authentication process, data transmission will not take place."
      solution    : "To implement the recommended configuration state, set the following Group Policy setting to 1.

Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security Options\Microsoft network server- Digitally sign communications (always)

Impact- The Windows 2000 and later implementations of the SMB file and print sharing protocol support mutual authentication, which protect against session hijacking attacks and support message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then verified by both the client and the server. Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server that is serving as a domain controller, file server, print server, and application server performance may be substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB communications, older applications and operating systems will not be able to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks. When SMB signing policies are enabled on domain controllers running Windows Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows Server 2008 group policy processing will fail.

Impact- The Windows 2000 and later implementations of the SMB file and print sharing protocol support mutual authentication, which protect against session hijacking attacks and support message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then verified by both the client and the server. Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server that is serving as a domain controller, file server, print server, and application server performance may be substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB communications, older applications and operating systems will not be able to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks.

Client computers that have this policy setting enabled will also be unable to connect to Terminal Services on servers that are not configured to use the FIPS compliant algorithms. Note If you enable this policy setting, computer performance will be slower because the 3DES process is performed on each block of data in the file three times. This policy setting should only be enabled if your organization is required to be FIPS compliant. Important: This setting is recorded in different registry locations depending upon the version of Windows being used.

Note Microsoft released several security updates in October 2003 that used a version of Update.exe that required the administrator to have the Debug programs user right.

When configuring a user right in the SCM enter a comma delimited list of accounts. Accounts can be either local or located in Active Directory, they can be groups, users, or computers. Note: Discrepancies between the time on the local computer and on the domain controllers in your environment may cause problems for the Kerberos authentication protocol, which could make it impossible for users to log on to the domain or obtain authorization to access domain resources after they are logged on. Also, problems will occur when Group Policy is applied to client computers if the system time is not synchronized with the domain controllers. Users who can change the time on a computer could cause several problems. For example, time stamps on event log entries could be made inaccurate, time stamps on files and folders that are created or modified could be incorrect, and computers that belong to a domain may not be able to authenticate themselves or users who try to log on to the domain from them. Also, because the Kerberos authentication protocol requires that the requestor and authenticator have their clocks synchronized within an administrator-defined skew period, an attacker who changes a computer's time may cause that computer to be unable to obtain or grant Kerberos tickets. The risk from these types of events is mitigated on most domain controllers, member servers, and end-user computers because the Windows Time service automatically synchronizes time with domain controllers in the following ways: . All client desktop computers and member servers use the authenticating domain controller as their inbound time partner. . All domain controllers in a domain nominate the primary domain controller (PDC) emulator operations master as their inbound time partner. . All PDC emulator operations masters follow the hierarchy of domains in the selection of their inbound time partner. . The PDC emulator operations master at the root of the domain is authoritative for the organization. Therefore it is recommended that you configure this computer to synchronize with a reliable external time server.

Impact- When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information unless the retention method for each is set so that the computer will overwrite the oldest entries with the most recent ones. To mitigate the risk of loss of recent data, you can configure the retention method so that older events are overwritten as needed. The consequence of this configuration is that older events will be removed from the logs. Attackers can take advantage of such a configuration, because they can generate a large number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of their attack. These risks can be somewhat reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log data. Ideally, all specifically monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft Operations Manager (MOM) or some other automated monitoring tool. Such a configuration is particularly important because an attacker who successfully compromises a server could clear the Security log. If all events are sent to a monitoring server, then you will be able to gather forensic information about the attacker's activities."

It is imperative that the Application log is archived regularly if historical events are desirable for either forensics or troubleshooting purposes. Overwriting events as needed ensures that the log always stores the most recent events, although this configuration could result in a loss of historical data. If you significantly increase the number of objects to audit in your organization, there is a risk that the Security log will reach its capacity and force the computer to shut down. If such a shutdown occurs, the computer will be unusable until an administrator clears the Security log. To prevent such a shutdown, you can disable the Audit: Shut down system immediately if unable to log security audits setting that is described in Security Options and then increase the Security log size. If you set the Event log retention method to Manual or Overwrite events by days, it is possible for important recent events to not be recorded or for a DoS attack to occur."

If you add a program to this list and set its status to Enabled, that program can receive unsolicited incoming messages on any port that it requests Windows Firewall to open, even if that port is blocked by another setting. If you configure this policy setting to Disabled, the program exceptions list that is defined by Group Policy is deleted. Note If you type an invalid definition string, Windows Firewall adds it to the list without checking for errors. Because the entry is not checked, you can add programs that you have not installed yet. You can also accidentally create multiple exceptions for the same program with Scope or Status values that conflict."

If the Report Errors setting is enabled, it will override any settings that are made through the Control Panel for error reporting. This configuration will also enforce the default values for any error reporting policies that are not configured. In its default configuration, the Windows Corporate Error Reporting features of Windows XP and Office will send data to Microsoft that some organizations may prefer to keep confidential. The Microsoft privacy statement for Windows Corporate Error Reporting ensures that Microsoft will not misuse data that is collected through Windows Corporate Error Reporting. However, some organizations may want to configure this feature so that no information is transmitted outside of the organization without first being reviewed by a trusted member of the IT team. Conversely, if error reporting is disabled completely, it is more difficult for Microsoft to identify and diagnose new bugs. Organizations that develop their own internal business applications can also take advantage of Windows Corporate Error Reporting to track down problems within their code. A reasonable configuration that ensures privacy and uses Windows Corporate Error Reporting effectively is to set up your own internal Corporate Error Reporting (CER) servers. Configure your client computers to point to these servers when they have error reports to submit. An administrator can then review the reports on the CER server and generate an aggregate report for Microsoft that contains no confidential information."
