Microsoft ActiveX controls and file downloads often have digital signatures attached that
help certify the file's integrity and the identity of the signer (creator) of the software. Such
signatures help ensure that unmodified software is downloaded and that you can identify
active signers to determine whether you trust them enough to run their software.The Allow software to run or install even if the signature is invalid setting allows you to
manage whether downloaded software can be installed or run by users even though the
signature is invalid. An invalid signature might indicate that someone has tampered with
the file. If you enable this policy setting, users will be prompted to install or run files with
an invalid signature. If you disable this policy setting, users cannot run or install files with
an invalid signature.


Note- Some legitimate software and controls may have an invalid signature and still be OK.
You should carefully test such software in isolation before you allow it to be used on your
organization's network. The recommended state for this setting is- Disabled.

*Rationale*

Microsoft ActiveX controls and file downloads often have digital signatures attached that
certify the file's integrity and the identity of the signer (creator) of the software. Such
signatures help ensure that unmodified software is downloaded and that you can positively
identify the signer to determine whether you trust them enough to run their software. The
validity of unsigned code cannot be ascertained."

*Rationale*

Per-user installation of ActiveX controls is a convenient feature that many organizations
may want to leverage. One benefit is that even if the user installs a control that includes a
malicious payload its impact will be limited to the privileges of the user who installed it.
Nevertheless, restricting the installation of ActiveX controls to administrators and using the
ActiveX Installer Service or some other centralized software deployment tool is a more
effective method for avoiding malware."

*Rationale*

This policy setting prevents ActiveX controls from running in Protected Mode when
Enhanced Protected Mode is enabled. When a user has an ActiveX control installed that is
not compatible with Enhanced Protected Mode and a website attempts to load the control,
Internet Explorer notifies the user and gives the option to run the website in regular
Protected Mode. This policy setting disables this notification and forces all websites to run
in Enhanced Protected Mode.
Enhanced Protected Mode provides additional protection against malicious websites by
using 64-bit processes on 64-bit versions of Windows. For computers running Windows 8
and above, Enhanced Protected Mode also limits the locations Internet Explorer can read
from in the registry and the file system.
When Enhanced Protected Mode is enabled, and a user encounters a website that attempts
to load an ActiveX control that is not compatible with Enhanced Protected Mode, Internet
Explorer notifies the user and gives the option to disable Enhanced Protected Mode for that
particular website.
If you enable this policy setting, Internet Explorer will not give the user the option to
disable Enhanced Protected Mode. All Protected Mode websites will run in Enhanced
Protected Mode.
If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Internet Explorer notifies users and
provides an option to run websites with incompatible ActiveX controls in regular Protected

This policy setting allows you to turn off support for Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0,
TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 2.0 or SSL 3.0 in the browser. TLS and SSL are
protocols for protecting communication between the browser and the target server. When
the browser attempts to set up a protected communication with the target server, the
browser and server negotiate which protocol and version to use. The browser and server
attempt to match each others list of supported protocols and versions and pick the most
preferred match. If you enable this policy setting, the browser will or will not negotiate an
encryption tunnel with the encryption methods you select through the drop down list. If
you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the user can select which encryption
method the browser will support. The recommended state for this settings is Use TLS 1.1
and TLS 1.2. Only use TLS 1.2 also conforms with this guidance.

*Rationale*

Risk is reduced by preventing Internet Explorer from communicating over protocols, such
as SSL v2.0 and SSL v3.0, that suffer from known practical attacks."

Internet Explorer uses Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) data to determine
file handling procedures for files that are received through a Web server. The Consistent
MIME Handling setting determines whether Internet Explorer requires that all file type
information that is provided by Web servers be consistent. For example, if the MIME type
of a file is text/plain but the MIME data indicates that the file is really an executable file,
Internet Explorer changes its extension to reflect this executable status. This capability
helps ensure that executable code cannot masquerade as other types of data that may be
trusted. The recommended state for this setting is- Enabled.

*Rationale*

MIME file type spoofing is a potential threat to your organization. You should ensure that
these files are consistent and properly labeled to help prevent malicious file downloads
that may infect your network.

This policy setting allows you to manage settings for logon options. If you enable this policy
setting, you can choose from the following logon options- Anonymous logon disables HTTP
authentication and uses the guest account only for the Common Internet File System (CIFS)
protocol. Prompt for user name and password queries users for user IDs and passwords.
After a user is queried, these values can be used silently for the remainder of the session.
Automatic logon only in Intranet zone queries users for user IDs and passwords in other
zones. After a user is queried, these values can be used silently for the remainder of the
session. Automatic logon with current user name and password attempts logon using
Windows NT Challenge Response (also known as NTLM authentication). If Windows NT
Challenge Response is supported by the server, the logon uses the user's network user
name and password for logon. If Windows NT Challenge Response is not supported by the
server, the user is queried to provide the user name and password. If you disable this
policy setting, logon is set to Automatic logon only in Intranet zone. If you do not configure
this policy setting, logon is set to Automatic logon only in Intranet zone. The recommended
state for this setting is- Enabled-Prompt for user name and password.

*Rationale*

Users could submit credentials to servers operated by malicious people who could then
attempt to connect to legitimate servers with those captured credentials."
