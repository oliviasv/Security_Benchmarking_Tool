      info        : "This policy setting allows accounts to log on using the task scheduler service.

Because the task scheduler is often used for administrative purposes, it may be needed in enterprise environments.

However, its use should be restricted in high security environments to prevent misuse of system resources or to prevent attackers from using the right to launch malicious code after gaining user level access to a computer.

 The recommended state for this setting is: 'Administrators'.

 Rationale:

 The 'Log on as a batch job' user right presents a low-risk vulnerability.

For most organizations, the default settings are sufficient."
      solution    : "To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 'Administrators':


Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights Assignment\Log on as a batch job


Impact:

If you configure the 'Log on as a batch job' setting through domain-based Group Policies, the computer will not be able to assign the user right to accounts that are used for scheduled jobs in the Task Scheduler.

If you install optional components such as ASP.NET or IIS, you might need to assign this user right to additional accounts that are required by those components.

For example, IIS requires assignment of this user right to the 'IIS_WPG' group and the 'IUSR_'_(ComputerName)_, 'ASPNET', and 'IWAM_'_(ComputerName)_ accounts.

If this user right is not assigned to this group and these accounts, IIS will be unable to run some COM objects that are necessary for proper functionality."

This user right should be restricted on any computer in a high security environment, but because many applications may require this privilege, it should be carefully evaluated and tested before configuring it in an enterprise environment.

On Windows Vista-based (and newer) computers, no users or groups have this privilege by default.

 The recommended state for this setting is: 'No One'.

 Rationale:

 'Log on as a service' is a powerful user right because it allows accounts to launch network services or services that run continuously on a computer, even when no one is logged on to the console.

The risk is reduced by the fact that only users with administrative privileges can install and configure services.

An attacker who has already attained that level of access could configure the service to run with the 'Local System' account."

This security setting determines who is allowed to install a printer driver as part of connecting to a shared printer.

 The recommended state for this setting is: 'Enabled'.

 Note: This setting does not affect the ability to add a local printer.

This setting does not affect Administrators.

 Rationale:

 It may be appropriate in some organizations to allow users to install printer drivers on their own workstations.

However, in a high security environment, you should allow only Administrators, not users, to do this, because printer driver installation may unintentionally cause the computer to become less stable.

A malicious user could install inappropriate printer drivers in a deliberate attempt to damage the computer, or a user might accidentally install malicious software that masquerades as a printer driver.

It is feasible for an attacker to disguise a Trojan horse program as a printer driver.

The program may appear to users as if they must use it to print, but such a program could unleash malicious code on your computer network."

 Failed password attempts against workstations or member servers that have been locked using either CTRL+ALT+DELETE or password protected screen savers counts as failed logon attempts.

 The machine lockout policy is enforced only on those machines that have BitLocker enabled for protecting OS volumes.

Please ensure that appropriate recovery password backup policies are enabled.

 The recommended state for this setting is: '10 or fewer invalid logon attempts, but not 0'.

 Note: A value of '0' does not conform to the benchmark as it disables the machine account lockout threshold.

Values from '1' to '3' will be interpreted as '4'.

 Rationale:

 If a machine is lost or stolen, or if an insider threat attempts a brute force password attack against the computer, it is important to ensure that BitLocker will lock the computer and therefore prevent a successful attack."

      info        : "Ensure 'Interactive logon: Number of previous logons to cache (in case domain controller is not available)' is set to '4 or fewer logon(s)'

This policy setting determines whether a user can log on to a Windows domain using cached account information.

Logon information for domain accounts can be cached locally to allow users to log on even if a Domain Controller cannot be contacted.

This policy setting determines the number of unique users for whom logon information is cached locally.

If this value is set to 0, the logon cache feature is disabled.

An attacker who is able to access the file system of the server could locate this cached information and use a brute force attack to determine user passwords.

 The recommended state for this setting is: '4 or fewer logon(s)'.

 Rationale:

 The number that is assigned to this policy setting indicates the number of users whose logon information the computer will cache locally.

If the number is set to 4, then the computer caches logon information for 4 users.

When a 5th user logs on to the computer, the server overwrites the oldest cached logon session.

 Users who access the computer console will have their logon credentials cached on that computer.

An attacker who is able to access the file system of the computer could locate this cached information and use a brute force attack to attempt to determine user passwords.

To mitigate this type of attack, Windows encrypts the information and obscures its physical location."
      solution    : "To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to '4 or fewer logon(s)':


 Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security Options\Interactive logon: Number of previous logons to cache (in case domain controller is not available)


 Impact:

 Users will be unable to log on to any computers if there is no Domain Controller available to authenticate them.

Organizations may want to configure this value to 2 for end-user computers, especially for mobile users.

A configuration value of 2 means that the user's logon information will still be in the cache, even if a member of the IT department has recently logged on to their computer to perform system maintenance.

This method allows users to log on to their computers when they are not connected to the organization's network."

      info        : "Ensure 'System cryptography: Force strong key protection for user keys stored on the computer' is set to 'User is prompted when the key is first used' or higher

This policy setting determines whether users' private keys (such as their S-MIME keys) require a password to be used.

 The recommended state for this setting is: 'User is prompted when the key is first used'.

Configuring this setting to 'User must enter a password each time they use a key' also conforms to the benchmark.

 Rationale:

 If a user's account is compromised or their computer is inadvertently left unsecured the malicious user can use the keys stored for the user to access protected resources.

You can configure this policy setting so that users must provide a password that is distinct from their domain password every time they use a key.

This configuration makes it more difficult for an attacker to access locally stored user keys, even if the attacker takes control of the user's computer and determines their logon password."
      solution    : "To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 'User is prompted when the key is first used' (configuring to ''User must enter a password each time they use a key'' also conforms to the benchmark):


 Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security Options\System cryptography: Force strong key protection for user keys stored on the computer


 Impact:

 Users will have to enter their password the first time they access a key that is stored on their computer.

For example, if users use an S-MIME certificate to digitally sign their e-mail they will be forced to enter the password for that certificate the first time that they send a signed e-mail message.

For even stronger security, the value 'User must enter a password each time they use a key' can be set, but the overhead that is involved using this configuration may be too high for some organizations.

 Microsoft does not recommend enforcing this setting on servers due to the significant impact on manageability.

For example, you may not be able to configure Remote Desktop Services to use SSL certificates.

This value controls how often TCP attempts to verify that an idle connection is still intact by sending a keep-alive packet.

If the remote computer is still reachable, it acknowledges the keep-alive packet.

 The recommended state for this setting is: ''Enabled: 300,000 or 5 minutes (recommended)''.

 Rationale:

 An attacker who is able to connect to network applications could establish numerous connections to cause a DoS condition."

 Impact:

 Keep-alive packets are not sent by default by Windows.

However, some applications may configure the TCP stack flag that requests keep-alive packets.

For such configurations, you can lower this value from the default setting of two hours to five minutes to disconnect inactive sessions more quickly."

      info        : "Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is a set of protocols that computers use to exchange information over the Internet and over home and business networks.

IPv6 allows for many more IP addresses to be assigned than IPv4 did.

Older networking, hosts and operating systems may not support IPv6 natively.

 The recommended state for this setting is: 'DisabledComponents - 0xff (255)'

 Rationale:

 Since the vast majority of private enterprise managed networks have no need to utilize IPv6 (because they have access to private IPv4 addressing), disabling IPv6 components reduces a possible attack surface that is also harder to monitor the traffic on.

As a result, we recommend configuring IPv6 to a Disabled state when it is not needed."
      solution    : "To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Registry value to '0xff (255) (DWORD)':


 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TCPIP6\Parameters:DisabledComponents


 Note: This change does not take effect until the computer has been restarted.

 'Note #2:' Although Microsoft does not provide an ADMX template to configure this registry value, a custom .ADM template ('Disable-IPv6-Components-KB929852.adm') is provided in the CIS Benchmark Remediation Kit to facilitate its configuration.

Be aware though that simply turning off the group policy setting in the .ADM template will not 'undo' the change once applied.

Instead, the opposite setting must be applied to change the registry value to the opposite state.

 Impact:

 Connectivity to other systems using IPv6 will no longer operate, and software that depends on IPv6 will cease to function.

Examples of Microsoft applications that may use IPv6 include: Remote Assistance, HomeGroup, DirectAccess, Windows Mail.

 This registry change is documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base article 929852: [How to disable IPv6 or its components in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929852).

This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

 The 'Allow data recovery agent' check box is used to specify whether a Data Recovery Agent can be used with BitLocker-protected fixed data drives.

Before a Data Recovery Agent can be used it must be added from the Public Key Policies item in either the Group Policy Management Console or the Local Group Policy Editor.

Consult the BitLocker Drive Encryption Deployment Guide on Microsoft TechNet for more information about adding Data Recovery Agents.

 In 'Configure user storage of BitLocker recovery information' select whether users are allowed, required, or not allowed to generate a 48-digit recovery password or a 256-bit recovery key.

 Select 'Omit recovery options from the BitLocker setup wizard' to prevent users from specifying recovery options when they enable BitLocker on a drive.

This means that you will not be able to specify which recovery option to use when you enable BitLocker, instead BitLocker recovery options for the drive are determined by the policy setting.

 In 'Save BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain Services' choose which BitLocker recovery information to store in AD DS for fixed data drives.

If you select 'Backup recovery password and key package', both the BitLocker recovery password and key package are stored in AD DS.

Storing the key package supports recovering data from a drive that has been physically corrupted.

If you select 'Backup recovery password only', only the recovery password is stored in AD DS.

 Select the 'Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for fixed data drives' check box if you want to prevent users from enabling BitLocker unless the computer is connected to the domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery information to AD DS succeeds.

 Note: If the 'Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for fixed data drives' check box is selected, a recovery password is automatically generated.

 Rationale:

This limits each PIN digit to one of ten possibilities.

The TPM has an anti-hammering feature that includes a mechanism to exponentially increase the delay for PIN retry attempts; however, an attacker is able to more effectively mount a brute force attack using a domain of 10 digits of the function keys."

 Secure Boot ensures that the PC's pre-boot environment only loads firmware that is digitally signed by authorized software publishers.

Secure Boot also provides more flexibility for managing pre-boot configuration than legacy BitLocker integrity checks.

 Secure Boot requires a system that meets the UEFI 2.3.1 Specifications for Class 2 and Class 3 computers.

 When this policy is enabled and the hardware is capable of using Secure Boot for BitLocker scenarios, the 'Use enhanced Boot Configuration Data validation profile' group policy setting is ignored and Secure Boot verifies BCD settings according to the Secure Boot policy setting, which is configured separately from BitLocker.

 Note: If the group policy setting 'Configure TPM platform validation profile for native UEFI firmware configurations' is enabled and has PCR 7 omitted, BitLocker will be prevented from using Secure Boot for platform or Boot Configuration Data (BCD) integrity validation.

 In 'Save BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain Services', choose which BitLocker recovery information to store in AD DS for operating system drives.

Storing the key package supports recovering data from a drive that has been physically corrupted.

If you select 'Backup recovery password only', only the recovery password is stored in AD DS.

 The recommended state for this setting is: 'Enabled: Store recovery passwords and key packages'.

 Rationale:

 Should a user lose their primary means for accessing an encrypted OS volume, or should the system not pass its boot time integrity checks, the system will go into recovery mode.

If the recovery key has not been backed up to Active Directory, the user would need to have saved the recovery key to another location such as a USB flash drive, or have printed the recovery password, and now have access to one of those in order to recovery the system.

If the user is unable to produce the recovery key, then the user will be denied access to the encrypted volume and subsequently any data that is stored there."

This policy setting allows you to configure whether BitLocker requires additional authentication each time the computer starts.

This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

 Note: Only one of the additional authentication options can be _required_ at startup, otherwise a policy error occurs.

 On a computer with a compatible TPM, four types of authentication methods can be used at startup to provide added protection for encrypted data.

When the computer starts, it can use only the TPM for authentication, or it can also require insertion of a USB flash drive containing a startup key, the entry of a 4-digit to 20-digit personal identification number (PIN), or both.

 The recommended state for this setting is: 'Enabled: Require startup PIN with TPM'.

 Rationale:

 TPM without use of a PIN will only validate early boot components and does not require a user to enter any additional authentication information.

If a computer is lost or stolen in this configuration, BitLocker will not provide any additional measure of protection beyond what is provided by native Windows authentication unless the early boot components are tampered with or the encrypted drive is removed from the machine."

Before a Data Recovery Agent can be used it must be added from the Public Key Policies item in either the Group Policy Management Console or the Local Group Policy Editor.

Consult the BitLocker Drive Encryption Deployment Guide on Microsoft TechNet for more information about adding Data Recovery Agents.

 Select 'Omit recovery options from the BitLocker setup wizard' to prevent users from specifying recovery options when they enable BitLocker on a drive.

This means that you will not be able to specify which recovery option to use when you enable BitLocker, instead BitLocker recovery options for the drive are determined by the policy setting.

This policy setting allows you to control how BitLocker-protected removable data drives are recovered in the absence of the required credentials.

This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

 Select the 'Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for removable data drives' check box if you want to prevent users from enabling BitLocker unless the computer is connected to the domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery information to AD DS succeeds.

 Note: If the 'Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for removable data drives' check box is selected, a recovery password is automatically generated.

 The recommended state for this setting is: 'Enabled: False' (unchecked).

 Rationale:

 Administrators should always have a safe, secure way to access encrypted data in the event users cannot access their data.

 Additionally, as with any authentication method, a drive can be compromised by guessing or finding the authentication information used to access the drive.

 To use BitLocker a Data Recovery Agent will need to be configured for removable drives.

To recover a drive will require highly-controlled access to the Data Recovery Agent private key."

 The recommended state for this setting is: 'Disabled'.

 Note: The GPME help text for this setting is incorrectly worded, implying that configuring it to Enabled will reject new Remote Shell connections, and setting it to Disabled will allow Remote Shell connections.

The opposite is true (and is consistent with the title of the setting).

This is a wording mistake by Microsoft in the Administrative Template.

 Rationale:

 Any feature is a potential avenue of attack, those that enable inbound network connections are particularly risky.

Only enable the use of the Windows Remote Shell on trusted networks and when feasible employ additional controls such as IPsec."
