More information on system requirements for this feature can be found at this link:

Windows Defender Credential Guard Requirements (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs

Rationale:

Kerberos, NTLM, and Credential manager isolate secrets by using virtualization-based security. Previous versions of Windows stored secrets in the Local Security Authority (LSA). Prior to Windows 10, the LSA stored secrets used by the operating system in its process memory. With Windows Defender Credential Guard enabled, the LSA process in the operating system talks to a new component called the isolated LSA process that stores and protects those secrets. Data stored by the isolated LSA process is protected using virtualization-based security and is not accessible to the rest of the operating system."

Rationale:

The primary purpose of Windows Defender Application Guard (WDAG) is to present a 'sandboxed container' for visiting untrusted websites. If the host clipboard is made available to WDAG, a compromised WDAG session will have access to its content, potentially exposing sensitive information to a malicious website or application. However, the risk is reduced if the WDAG clipboard is made accessible to the host, and indeed that functionality may often be necessary from an operational standpoint."

Note #2: At time of publication, Windows Defender Application Guard (WDAG) in all currently released versions of Windows 10 does not yet support protection for Microsoft Office, only for Microsoft Edge. Therefore the additional available options of 2 and 3 in this setting are not yet valid.

Rationale:

Windows Defender Application Guard (WDAG) uses Windows Hypervisor to create a virtualized environment for apps that are configured to use virtualization-based security isolation. While in isolation, improper user interactions and app vulnerabilities can't compromise the kernel or any other apps running outside of the virtualized environment."

Impact:

Windows Defender Application Guard (WDAG) will be turned on for Microsoft Edge.

Note: WDAG requires the Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) (SharedAccess) service in order to operate, so an exception to disabling this service (see Section 5) will be required if choosing to enable WDAG.
