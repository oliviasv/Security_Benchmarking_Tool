      description     : "1.1.1.1.1.4 Configure 'Maximum tolerance for computer clock synchronization'"
      info            : "Many security services, especially authentication, rely on an accurate computer clock to perform their jobs. You should ensure computer time is accurate and that all servers in your organization use the same time source. The Windows Server 2003 W32Time service provides time synchronization for Windows Server 2003 and Microsoft Windows XPbased computers that run in an Active Directory domain. The W32Time service synchronizes the clocks of Windows Server 2003based computers with the domain controllers in a domain. This synchronization is necessary for the Kerberos protocol and other authentication protocols to work properly. To function correctly, a number of Windows Server family components rely on accurate and synchronized time. If the clocks are not synchronized on the clients, the Kerberos authentication protocol might deny access to users. Another important benefit that time synchronization provides is event correlation on all of the clients in your enterprise. Synchronized clocks on the clients in your environment ensure that you can correctly analyze events that take place in uniform sequence on those clients throughout the organization. The W32Time service uses the Network Time Protocol (NTP) to synchronize clocks on computers that run Windows Server 2003. In a Windows Server 2003 forest, time is synchronized by default in the following manner: . The primary domain controller (PDC) emulator operations master in the forest root domain is the authoritative time source for the organization. . All PDC operation masters in other domains in the forest follow the hierarchy of domains when they select a PDC emulator with which to synchronize their time. . All domain controllers in a domain synchronize their time with the PDC emulator operations master in their domain as their inbound time partner. . All member servers and client desktop computers use the authenticating domain controller as their inbound time partner. To ensure that the time is accurate, the PDC emulator in the forest root domain can be synchronized to an authoritative time source, such as a reliable NTP source or a highly accurate clock on your network. Note that NTP synchronization uses UDP port 123 traffic. Before you synchronize with an external server, you should weigh the benefits of opening this port against the potential security risk. Also, if you synchronize with an external server that you do not control, you risk configuring your servers with the incorrect time. The external server could be compromised or spoofed by an attacker to maliciously manipulate the clocks on your computers. As explained earlier, the Kerberos authentication protocol requires synchronized computer clocks. If they are not synchronized, a denial of service may occur. To prevent 'replay attacks,' the Kerberos authentication protocol uses time stamps as part of its protocol definition. For time stamps to work properly, the clocks of the client and the domain controller need to be closely synchronized. Because the clocks of two computers are often not synchronized, administrators can use this policy to establish the maximum acceptable difference to Kerberos between a client clock and a domain controller clock. If the difference between the client clock and the domain controller clock is less than the maximum time difference specified in this setting, any time stamp that is used in a session between the two computers is considered to be authentic."

If the Account lockout threshold is defined, this reset time must be less than or equal to the value for the Account lockout duration setting.

An attacker could maliciously perform a number of failed logon attempts on all users in the organization, which will lock out their accounts. If no policy were determined to reset the account lockout, it would be a manual task for administrators. Conversely, if a reasonable time value is configured for this policy setting, users would be locked out for a set period until all of the accounts are unlocked automatically. Users can accidentally lock themselves out of their accounts if they mistype their password multiple times. To reduce the chance of such accidental lockouts, the Reset account lockout counter after setting determines the number of minutes that must elapse before the counter that tracks failed logon attempts and triggers lockouts is reset to 0."

Impact- If you do not configure this policy setting or if the value is configured to an interval that is too long, a denial of service (DoS) attack could occur.

      info           : "This policy setting determines the number of failed logon attempts before a lock occurs. Authorized users can lock themselves out of an account by mistyping their password or by remembering it incorrectly, or by changing their password on one computer while logged on to another computer. The computer with the incorrect password will continuously try to authenticate the user, and because the password it uses to authenticate is incorrect, a lock occurs. To avoid accidental lockout of authorized users, set the account lockout threshold to a high number. The default value for this policy setting is 0 invalid logon attempts, which disables the account lockout feature. Because it is possible for an attacker to use this lockout state as a denial of service (DoS) by triggering a lockout on a large number of accounts, your organization should determine whether to use this policy setting based on identified threats and the risks you want to mitigate. There are two options to consider for this policy setting. #x2022; Configure the value for Account lockout threshold to 0 to ensure that accounts will not be locked out. This setting value will prevent a DoS attack that attempts to lock out accounts in your organization. It will also reduce help desk calls, because users will not be able to lock themselves out of their accounts accidentally. However, this setting value will not prevent a brute force attack. The following defenses should also be considered: #x2022; A password policy that forces all users to have complex passwords made up of 8 or more characters. #x2022; A robust auditing mechanism, which will alert administrators when a series of account lockouts occurs in the environment. For example, the auditing solution should monitor for security event 539, which is a logon failure. This event identifies that there was a lock on the account at the time of the logon attempt. The second option is: #x2022; Configure the value for Account lockout threshold to a value that provides users with the ability to mistype their password several times, but locks out the account if a brute force password attack occurs. This configuration will prevent accidental account lockouts and reduce help desk calls, but will not prevent a DoS attack. Password attacks can use automated methods to try millions of password combinations for any user account. The effectiveness of such attacks can be almost eliminated if you limit the number of failed logons that can be performed. However, a denial of service (DoS) attack could be performed on a domain that has an account lockout threshold configured. An attacker could programmatically attempt a series of password attacks against all users in the organization. If the number of attempts is greater than the account lockout threshold, the attacker might be able to lock out every account."
      solution       : "Navigate to the Group Policy UI path expressed in the Audit procedure and set Account lockout threshold as recommended.

Impact- If this policy setting is enabled, a locked-out account will not be usable until it is reset by an administrator or until the account lockout duration expires. This setting will likely generate a number of additional help desk calls. In fact, locked accounts cause the greatest number of calls to the help desk in many organizations. If you enforce this setting an attacker could cause a denial of service condition by deliberately generating failed logons for multiple user, therefore you should also configure the Account Lockout Duration to a relatively low value such as 15 minutes. If you configure the Account Lockout Threshold to 0, there is a possibility that an attacker's attempt to discover passwords with a brute force password attack might go undetected if a robust audit mechanism is not in place."

The longer a password exists the higher the likelihood that it will be compromised by a brute force attack, by an attacker gaining general knowledge about the user, or by the user sharing the password.

Impact- If the Maximum password age setting is too low, users are required to change their passwords very often.

The value for this policy setting must be between 0 and 24 passwords. The default value for Windows Vista is 0 passwords, but the default setting in a domain is 24 passwords. To maintain the effectiveness of this policy setting, use the Minimum password age setting to prevent users from repeatedly changing their password. The longer a user uses the same password, the greater the chance that an attacker can determine the password through brute force attacks. Also, any accounts that may have been compromised will remain exploitable for as long as the password is left unchanged. If password changes are required but password reuse is not prevented, or if users continually reuse a small number of passwords, the effectiveness of a good password policy is greatly reduced. If you specify a low number for this policy setting, users will be able to use the same small number of passwords repeatedly.

      solution        : "Navigate to the Group Policy UI path expressed in the Audit procedure and set Enforce password history as recommended.

Impact- The major impact of this configuration is that users must create a new password every time they are required to change their old one. If users are required to change their passwords to new unique values, there is an increased risk of users who write their passwords somewhere so that they do not forget them. Another risk is that users may create passwords that change incrementally (for example, password01, password02, and so on) to facilitate memorization but make them easier to guess. Also, an excessively low value for the Minimum password age setting will likely increase administrative overhead, because users who forget their passwords might ask the help desk to reset them frequently."

When this policy is enabled, passwords must meet the following minimum requirements: #x2022; Not contain the user's account name or parts of the user's full name that exceed two consecutive characters #x2022; Be at least six characters in length #x2022; Contain characters from three of the following four categories: #x2022; English uppercase characters (A through Z) #x2022; English lowercase characters (a through z) #x2022; Base 10 digits (0 through 9) #x2022; Non-alphabetic characters (for example, !, $, #, %) #x2022; A catch-all category of any Unicode character that does not fall under the previous four categories. This fifth category can be regionally specific. Each additional character in a password increases its complexity exponentially. For instance, a seven-character, all lower-case alphabetic password would have 267 (approximately 8 x 109 or 8 billion) possible combinations. At 1,000,000 attempts per second (a capability of many password-cracking utilities), it would only take 133 minutes to crack. A seven-character alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 527 combinations. A seven-character case-sensitive alphanumeric password without punctuation has 627 combinations. An eight-character password has 268 (or 2 x 1011) possible combinations. Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000 attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords. Remember, these times will significantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and other special keyboard characters such as '!' or '@'. Proper use of the password settings can help make it difficult to mount a brute force attack. Passwords that contain only alphanumeric characters are extremely easy to discover with several publicly available tools."
      solution        : "Navigate to the Group Policy UI path expressed in the Audit procedure and set Password must meet complexity requirements as recommended.

Impact- If the default password complexity configuration is retained, additional help desk calls for locked-out accounts could occur because users might not be accustomed to passwords that contain non-alphabetic characters. However, all users should be able to comply with the complexity requirement with minimal difficulty. If your organization has more stringent security requirements, you can create a custom version of the Passfilt.dll file that allows the use of arbitrarily complex password strength rules. For example, a custom password filter might require the use of non-upper row characters. (Upper row characters are those that require you to hold down the SHIFT key and press any of the digits between 1 and 0.) A custom password filter might also perform a dictionary check to verify that the proposed password does not contain common dictionary words or fragments. Also, the use of ALT key character combinations can greatly enhance the complexity of a password. However, such stringent password requirements can result in unhappy users and an extremely busy help desk. Alternatively, your organization could consider a requirement for all administrator passwords to use ALT characters in the 0128#x00E2;#x20AC;#x201C;0159 range. (ALT characters outside of this range can represent standard alphanumeric characters that would not add additional complexity to the password.)"

There are many different theories about how to determine the best password length for an organization, but perhaps 'pass phrase' is a better term than 'password.' In Microsoft Windows 2000 or later, pass phrases can be quite long and can include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as 'I want to drink a $5 milkshake' is a valid pass phrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string of random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated about the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially with regard to password length. In enterprise environments, ensure that the value for the Minimum password length setting is configured to 8 characters. This policy setting is long enough to provide adequate security. In high security environments, configure the value to 12 characters. Types of password attacks include dictionary attacks (which attempt to use common words and phrases) and brute force attacks (which try every possible combination of characters). Also, attackers sometimes try to obtain the account database so they can use tools to discover the accounts and passwords."

Impact- Requirements for extremely long passwords can actually decrease the security of an organization, because users might leave the information in an insecure location or lose it. If very long passwords are required, mistyped passwords could cause account lockouts and increase the volume of help desk calls. If your organization has issues with forgotten passwords due to password length requirements, consider teaching your users about pass phrases, which are often easier to remember and, due to the larger number of character combinations, much harder to discover. Note- Older versions of Windows such as Windows 98 and Windows NT#x00AE; 4.0 do not support passwords that are longer than 14 characters.

This policy setting determines which behaviors are allowed for applications using the NTLM Security Support Provider (SSP). The SSP Interface (SSPI) is used by applications that need authentication services. The setting does not modify how the authentication sequence works but instead require certain behaviors in applications that use the SSPI. The possible values for the Network security: Minimum session security for NTLM SSP based (including secure RPC) clients setting are: . Require message confidentiality. This option is only available in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, the connection will fail if encryption is not negotiated. Encryption converts data into a form that is not readable until decrypted. . Require message integrity. This option is only available in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, the connection will fail if message integrity is not negotiated. The integrity of a message can be assessed through message signing. Message signing proves that the message has not been tampered with; it attaches a cryptographic signature that identifies the sender and is a numeric representation of the contents of the message. . Require 128-bit encryption. The connection will fail if strong encryption (128-bit) is not negotiated. . Require NTLMv2 session security. The connection will fail if the NTLMv2 protocol is not negotiated. . Not Defined. You can enable all of the options for this policy setting to help protect network traffic that uses the NTLM Security Support Provider (NTLM SSP) from being exposed or tampered with by an attacker who has gained access to the same network. In other words, these options help protect against man-in-the-middle attacks."

      info        : "LAN Manager (LM) is a family of early Microsoft client/server software that allows users to link personal computers together on a single network. Network capabilities include transparent file and print sharing, user security features, and network administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is the default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 (NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients when they perform the following operations: . Join a domain . Authenticate between Active Directory forests . Authenticate to down-level domains . Authenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, or Windows XP) . Authenticate to computers that are not in the domain The possible values for the Network security: LAN Manager authentication level setting are: . Send LM & NTLM responses . Send LM & NTLM use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated . Send NTLM responses only . Send NTLMv2 responses only . Send NTLMv2 responses only\refuse LM . Send NTLMv2 responses only\refuse LM & NTLM . Not Defined The Network security: LAN Manager authentication level setting determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice affects the authentication protocol level that clients use, the session security level that the computers negotiate, and the authentication level that servers accept as follows: . Send LM & NTLM responses. Clients use LM and NTLM authentication and never use NTLMv2 session security. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Send LM & NTLM use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated. Clients use LM and NTLM authentication and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Send NTLM response only. Clients use NTLM authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Send NTLMv2 response only. Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Send NTLMv2 response only\refuse LM. Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM (accept only NTLM and NTLMv2 authentication). . Send NTLMv2 response only\refuse LM & NTLM. Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM and NTLM (accept only NTLMv2 authentication). These settings correspond to the levels discussed in other Microsoft documents as follows: . Level 0 Send LM and NTLM response; never use NTLMv2 session security. Clients use LM and NTLM authentication, and never use NTLMv2 session security. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Level 1 Use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated. Clients use LM and NTLM authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Level 2 Send NTLM response only. Clients use only NTLM authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Level 3 Send NTLMv2 response only. Clients use NTLMv2 authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Level 4 Domain controllers refuse LM responses. Clients use NTLM authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM authentication, that is, they accept NTLM and NTLMv2. . Level 5 Domain controllers refuse LM and NTLM responses (accept only NTLMv2). Clients use NTLMv2 authentication, use and NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse NTLM and LM authentication (they accept only NTLMv2). In Windows Vista, this setting is undefined. However, in Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP clients are configured by default to send LM and NTLM authentication responses (Windows 95-based and Windows 98-based clients only send LM). The default setting on servers allows all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resources. However, this means that LM responses the weakest form of authentication response are sent over the network, and it is potentially possible for attackers to sniff that traffic to more easily reproduce the user's password. The Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems cannot use the Kerberos version 5 protocol for authentication. For this reason, in a Windows Server 2003 domain, these computers authenticate by default with both the LM and NTLM protocols for network authentication. You can enforce a more secure authentication protocol for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the logon process, NTLMv2 uses a secure channel to protect the authentication process. Even if you use NTLMv2 for earlier clients and servers, Windows-based clients and servers that are members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to authenticate with Windows Server 2003 domain controllers."

This setting is used to control the attack surface of the computer for DCOM applications. You can use this policy setting to specify access permissions to all the computers to particular users for DCOM applications in the enterprise. When you specify the users or groups that are to be given permission, the security descriptor field is populated with the Security Descriptor Definition Language representation of those groups and privileges.

Administrators cannot override these settings to force stronger security in earlier versions of Windows without modifying the application. An attacker could attempt to exploit weak security in an individual application by attacking it through COM calls. Also, COM infrastructure includes the Remote Procedure Call System Service (RPCSS), a system service that runs during computer startup and always runs after that. This service manages activation of COM objects and the running object table, and provides helper services to DCOM remoting. It exposes RPC interfaces that can be called remotely. Because some COM servers allow unauthenticated remote access, these interfaces can be called by anyone, including unauthenticated users. As a result, RPCSS can be attacked by malicious users who use remote, unauthenticated computers."

This policy setting determines which behaviors are allowed for applications using the NTLM Security Support Provider (SSP). The SSP Interface (SSPI) is used by applications that need authentication services. The setting does not modify how the authentication sequence works but instead require certain behaviors in applications that use the SSPI. The possible values for the Network security: Minimum session security for NTLM SSP based (including secure RPC) servers setting are: . Require message confidentiality.

When you define this setting, and specify the users or groups that are to be given permission, the security descriptor field is populated with the Security Descriptor Definition Language representation of those groups and privileges. If the security descriptor is left blank, the policy setting is defined in the template, but it is not enforced.

However, you can use this policy setting in Windows 2000 or later environments.

Impact- The Windows 2000 and later implementations of the SMB file and print sharing protocol support mutual authentication, which protect against session hijacking attacks and support message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then verified by both the client and the server. Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server that is serving as a domain controller, file server, print server, and application server performance may be substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB communications, older applications and operating systems will not be able to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks. When SMB signing policies are enabled on domain controllers running Windows Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows Server 2008 group policy processing will fail.

Microsoft recommends to enable The Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (if server agrees) setting. Note Enabling this policy setting on SMB clients on your network makes them fully effective for packet signing with all clients and servers in your environment. Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network as the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can potentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then them so that the server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the attacker could pose as the server or client after legitimate authentication and gain unauthorized access to data. SMB is the resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows operating systems. SMB signatures authenticate both users and the servers that host the data. If either side fails the authentication process, data transmission will not take place."
      solution    : "To implement the recommended configuration state, set the following Group Policy setting to 1.

Impact- The Windows 2000 and later implementations of the SMB file and print sharing protocol support mutual authentication, which protect against session hijacking attacks and support message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then verified by both the client and the server. Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server that is serving as a domain controller, file server, print server, and application server performance may be substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB communications, older applications and operating systems will not be able to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks. When SMB signing policies are enabled on domain controllers running Windows Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows Server 2008 group policy processing will fail.

Microsoft recommends to configure the Domain member: Digitally encrypt or sign secure channel data (always) setting to Enabled. When a computer joins a domain, a computer account is created. After it joins the domain, the computer uses the password for that account to create a secure channel with the domain controller for its domain every time that it restarts.

Impact- Digital encryption and signing of the secure channel is a good idea where it is supported. The secure channel protects domain credentials as they are sent to the domain controller. However, only Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 6a (SP6a) and subsequent versions of the Windows operating system support digital encryption and signing of the secure channel. Windows 98 Second Edition clients do not support it unless they have the Dsclient installed. Therefore, you cannot enable the Domain member- Digitally encrypt or sign secure channel data (always) setting on domain controllers that support Windows 98 clients as members of the domain. Potential impacts can include the following- . The ability to create or delete trust relationships with clients running versions of Windows earlier than Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a will be disabled. . Logons from clients running versions of Windows earlier than Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a will be disabled. . The ability to authenticate other domains' users from a domain controller running a version of Windows earlier than Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a in a trusted domain will be disabled. You can enable this policy setting after you eliminate all Windows 9x clients from the domain and upgrade all Windows NT 4.0 servers and domain controllers from trusted/trusting domains to Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a. You can enable the other two policy settings, Domain member- Digitally encrypt secure channel data (when possible) and Domain member- Digitally encrypt sign channel data (when possible), on all computers in the domain that support them and clients running versions of Windows earlier than Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a and applications that run on these versions of Windows will not be affected."

Enable this policy setting in a mixed environment to prevent downstream clients from using the workstation as a network server. Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network as the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress.

Alternatively, the attacker could pose as the server or client after legitimate authentication and gain unauthorized access to data. SMB is the resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows operating systems.SMB signatures authenticate both users and the servers that host the data.

Impact- The Windows 2000 and later implementations of the SMB file and print sharing protocol support mutual authentication, which protect against session hijacking attacks and support message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then verified by both the client and the server. Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server that is serving as a domain controller, file server, print server, and application server performance may be substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB communications, older applications and operating systems will not be able to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks. When SMB signing policies are enabled on domain controllers running Windows Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows Server 2008 group policy processing will fail.

None. Negotiate signing. Require signature. Not Defined Unsigned network traffic is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks in which an intruder captures the packets between the client and server, modifies them, and then forwards them to the server. For an LDAP server, this susceptibility means that an attacker could cause a server to make decisions that are based on false or altered data from the LDAP queries. To lower this risk in your network, you can implement strong physical security measures to protect the network infrastructure. Also, you can make all types of man-in-the-middle attacks extremely difficult if you require digital signatures on all network packets by means of IPsec authentication headers."

If no signing request comes from the client, a connection will be allowed without a signature if the Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always) setting is not enabled. Note Enable this policy setting on SMB clients on your network to make them fully effective for packet signing with all clients and servers in your environment. Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network as the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can potentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then them so that the server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the attacker could pose as the server or client after legitimate authentication and gain unauthorized access to data. SMB is the resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows operating systems. SMB signatures authenticate both users and the servers that host the data.

      solution    : "To implement the recommended configuration state, set the following Group Policy setting to 1.

Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security Options\Microsoft network server- Digitally sign communications (if client agrees)

Impact- The Windows 2000 and later implementations of the SMB file and print sharing protocol support mutual authentication, which protect against session hijacking attacks and support message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then verified by both the client and the server. Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server that is serving as a domain controller, file server, print server, and application server performance may be substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB communications, older applications and operating systems will not be able to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks. When SMB signing policies are enabled on domain controllers running Windows Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows Server 2008 group policy processing will fail.

The registry value entry NoDefaultExempt was added to the template file in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\IPSEC\ registry key. The entry appears as MSS: (NoDefaultExempt) Configure IPSec exemptions for various types of network traffic in the SCE. The default exemptions to IPsec policy filters are documented in the online help for the specific operating system. These filters make it possible for Internet Key Exchange (IKE) and the Kerberos authentication protocol to function. The filters also make it possible for the network Quality of Service (QoS) to be signaled (RSVP) when the data traffic is secured by IPsec, and for traffic that IPsec might not secure such as multicast and broadcast traffic. IPsec is increasingly used for basic host-firewall packet filtering, particularly in Internet-exposed scenarios, and the affect of these default exemptions has not been fully understood. Therefore, some IPsec administrators may create IPsec policies that they think are secure, but are not actually secure against inbound attacks that use the default exemptions. For additional information, see the Knowledge Base article 811832, IPSec Default Exemptions Can Be Used to Bypass IPsec Protection in Some Scenarios. As IPsec is increasingly used for basic host-firewall packet filtering, particularly in Internet-exposed scenarios, the affect of these default exemptions has not been fully understood. Some IPsec administrators may create IPsec policies that they think are secure, but are not actually secure against inbound attacks that use the default exemptions. Attackers could forge network traffic that appears to consist of legitimate IKE, RSVP, or Kerberos protocol packets but direct them to other network services on the host."

Note Microsoft released several security updates in October 2003 that used a version of Update.exe that required the administrator to have the Debug programs user right.

By default, the Debug programs user right is assigned only to administrators, which helps to mitigate the risk from this vulnerability.

The service account that is used for the cluster service needs the Debug programs privilege; if it does not have it, Windows Clustering will fail. For additional information about how to configure Windows Clustering in conjunction with computer hardening, see article 891597, How to apply more restrictive security settings on a Windows Server 2003based cluster server, in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (http-//go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=100746).

For example, the Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit tool Kill.exe requires this user right for administrators to terminate processes that they did not start. Task Manager will not be able to manage processes owned by other accounts. Also, some older versions of Update.exe (which is used to install Windows product updates) require the account that applies the update to have this user right.

Users who have been assigned the Create Computer Objects permission for an OU or the Computers container in Active Directory can add an unlimited number of computers to the domain, regardless of whether they have been assigned the Add workstations to a domain user right.By default, all users in the Authenticated Users group have the ability to add up to 10 computer accounts to an Active Directory domain.

In an Active Directory domain, each computer account is a full security principal with the ability to authenticate and access domain resources. However, some organizations may want to limit the number of computers in an Active Directory environment so that they can consistently track, build, and manage the computers.

When configuring a user right in the SCM enter a comma delimited list of accounts. Accounts can be either local or located in Active Directory, they can be groups, users, or computers. Note: Discrepancies between the time on the local computer and on the domain controllers in your environment may cause problems for the Kerberos authentication protocol, which could make it impossible for users to log on to the domain or obtain authorization to access domain resources after they are logged on. Also, problems will occur when Group Policy is applied to client computers if the system time is not synchronized with the domain controllers. Users who can change the time on a computer could cause several problems. For example, time stamps on event log entries could be made inaccurate, time stamps on files and folders that are created or modified could be incorrect, and computers that belong to a domain may not be able to authenticate themselves or users who try to log on to the domain from them. Also, because the Kerberos authentication protocol requires that the requestor and authenticator have their clocks synchronized within an administrator-defined skew period, an attacker who changes a computer's time may cause that computer to be unable to obtain or grant Kerberos tickets. The risk from these types of events is mitigated on most domain controllers, member servers, and end-user computers because the Windows Time service automatically synchronizes time with domain controllers in the following ways: . All client desktop computers and member servers use the authenticating domain controller as their inbound time partner. . All domain controllers in a domain nominate the primary domain controller (PDC) emulator operations master as their inbound time partner. . All PDC emulator operations masters follow the hierarchy of domains in the selection of their inbound time partner. . The PDC emulator operations master at the root of the domain is authoritative for the organization. Therefore it is recommended that you configure this computer to synchronize with a reliable external time server. This vulnerability becomes much more serious if an attacker is able to change the system time and then stop the Windows Time service or reconfigure it to synchronize with a time server that is not accurate."

To view and modify the port exceptions list, configure the setting to Enabled and then click the Show button. Note that if you type an invalid definition string, Windows Firewall adds it to the list without checking for errors, which means that you can accidentally create multiple entries for the same port with Scope or Status values that conflict.

Maximum ticket time (units): hours, minutes or days When a ticket (help request) expires, the user must send another request before an expert can connect to the computer. If you disable the Solicited Remote Assistance setting, users cannot send help requests and the expert cannot connect to their computers. If the Solicited Remote Assistance setting is not configured, users can configure solicited remote assistance through the Control Panel. The following settings are enabled by default in the Control Panel: Solicited Remote Assistance, Buddy support, and Remote control. The value for the Maximum ticket time is set to 30 days. If this policy setting is disabled, no one will be able to access Windows Vista client computers across the network. There is slight risk that a rogue administrator will gain access to another user's desktop session, however, they cannot connect to a user's computer unannounced or control it without permission from the user. When an expert tries to connect, the user can still choose to deny the connection or give the expert view-only privileges. The user must explicitly click the Yes button to allow the expert to remotely control the workstation."

Impact- If you enable this policy, users on this computer can use e-mail or file transfer to ask someone for help. Also, users can use instant messaging programs to allow connections to this computer, and you can configure additional Remote Assistance settings. If you disable this policy, users on this computer cannot use e-mail or file transfer to ask someone for help. Also, users cannot use instant messaging programs to allow connections to this computer. If you don't configure this policy, users can enable or disable Solicited (Ask for) Remote Assistance themselves in System Properties in Control Panel. Users can also configure Remote Assistance settings. If you enable this policy setting, you have two ways to allow helpers to provide Remote Assistance- 'Allow helpers to only view the computer' or 'Allow helpers to remotely control the computer.' The 'Maximum ticket time' setting sets a limit on the amount of time that a Remote Assistance invitation created by using e-mail or file transfer can remain open. The 'Select the method for sending e-mail invitations' setting specifies which e-mail standard to use to send Remote Assistance invitations. Depending on your e-mail program, you can use either the Mailto standard (the invitation recipient connects through an Internet link) or the SMAPI (Simple MAPI) standard (the invitation is attached to your e-mail message). This setting is not available in Windows Vista since SMAPI is the only method supported. If you enable this policy you should also enable appropriate firewall exceptions to allow Remote Assistance communications."

Not Configured If you do not configure this policy setting, users cannot adjust the setting in the Control Panel. The default configuration is Enabled in Windows XP Professional and Disabled in Windows Server 2003. If the Report Errors setting is enabled, it will override any settings that are made through the Control Panel for error reporting. This configuration will also enforce the default values for any error reporting policies that are not configured. In its default configuration, the Windows Corporate Error Reporting features of Windows XP and Office will send data to Microsoft that some organizations may prefer to keep confidential. The Microsoft privacy statement for Windows Corporate Error Reporting ensures that Microsoft will not misuse data that is collected through Windows Corporate Error Reporting. However, some organizations may want to configure this feature so that no information is transmitted outside of the organization without first being reviewed by a trusted member of the IT team. Conversely, if error reporting is disabled completely, it is more difficult for Microsoft to identify and diagnose new bugs. Organizations that develop their own internal business applications can also take advantage of Windows Corporate Error Reporting to track down problems within their code. A reasonable configuration that ensures privacy and uses Windows Corporate Error Reporting effectively is to set up your own internal Corporate Error Reporting (CER) servers. Configure your client computers to point to these servers when they have error reports to submit. An administrator can then review the reports on the CER server and generate an aggregate report for Microsoft that contains no confidential information."
