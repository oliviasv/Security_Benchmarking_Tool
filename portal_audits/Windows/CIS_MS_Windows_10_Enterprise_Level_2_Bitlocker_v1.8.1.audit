Because the task scheduler is often used for administrative purposes, it may be needed in enterprise environments. However, its use should be restricted in high security environments to prevent misuse of system resources or to prevent attackers from using the right to launch malicious code after gaining user level access to a computer.

The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators.

Rationale:

The Log on as a batch job user right presents a low-risk vulnerability. For most organizations, the default settings are sufficient."

Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights Assignment\Log on as a batch job

Impact:

If you configure the Log on as a batch job setting through domain-based Group Policies, the computer will not be able to assign the user right to accounts that are used for scheduled jobs in the Task Scheduler. If you install optional components such as ASP.NET or IIS, you might need to assign this user right to additional accounts that are required by those components. For example, IIS requires assignment of this user right to the IIS_WPG group and the IUSR_(ComputerName), ASPNET, and IWAM_(ComputerName) accounts. If this user right is not assigned to this group and these accounts, IIS will be unable to run some COM objects that are necessary for proper functionality.

On Windows Vista-based (and newer) computers, no users or groups have this privilege by default.

The recommended state for this setting is: No One or (when the Hyper-V feature is installed) NT VIRTUAL MACHINE\Virtual Machines.

Note: The Hyper-V feature was first introduced on Windows workstations with the 64-bit version of Windows 8.0, so the NT VIRTUAL MACHINE\Virtual Machines option does not apply to Windows 7 (or older) versions of Windows. Older OSes should only be configured for No One.

Rationale:

Log on as a service is a powerful user right because it allows accounts to launch network services or services that run continuously on a computer, even when no one is logged on to the console. The risk is reduced by the fact that only users with administrative privileges can install and configure services. An attacker who has already attained that level of access could configure the service to run with the Local System account."

Note: This setting does not affect the ability to add a local printer. This setting does not affect Administrators.

Rationale:

It may be appropriate in some organizations to allow users to install printer drivers on their own workstations. However, in a high security environment, you should allow only Administrators, not users, to do this, because printer driver installation may unintentionally cause the computer to become less stable. A malicious user could install inappropriate printer drivers in a deliberate attempt to damage the computer, or a user might accidentally install malicious software that masquerades as a printer driver. It is feasible for an attacker to disguise a Trojan horse program as a printer driver. The program may appear to users as if they must use it to print, but such a program could unleash malicious code on your computer network."

The recommended state for this setting is: 10 or fewer invalid logon attempts, but not 0.

Note: A value of 0 does not conform to the benchmark as it disables the machine account lockout threshold. Values from 1 to 3 will be interpreted as 4.

Rationale:

If a machine is lost or stolen, or if an insider threat attempts a brute force password attack against the computer, it is important to ensure that BitLocker will lock the computer and therefore prevent a successful attack."

      info        : "This policy setting determines whether a user can log on to a Windows domain using cached account information. Logon information for domain accounts can be cached locally to allow users to log on even if a Domain Controller cannot be contacted. This policy setting determines the number of unique users for whom logon information is cached locally. If this value is set to 0, the logon cache feature is disabled. An attacker who is able to access the file system of the server could locate this cached information and use a brute force attack to determine user passwords.

The recommended state for this setting is: 4 or fewer logon(s).

Rationale:

The number that is assigned to this policy setting indicates the number of users whose logon information the computer will cache locally. If the number is set to 4, then the computer caches logon information for 4 users. When a 5th user logs on to the computer, the server overwrites the oldest cached logon session.

Users who access the computer console will have their logon credentials cached on that computer. An attacker who is able to access the file system of the computer could locate this cached information and use a brute force attack to attempt to determine user passwords. To mitigate this type of attack, Windows encrypts the information and obscures its physical location."

Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security Options\Interactive logon: Number of previous logons to cache (in case domain controller is not available)

Impact:

Users will be unable to log on to any computers if there is no Domain Controller available to authenticate them. Organizations may want to configure this value to 2 for end-user computers, especially for mobile users. A configuration value of 2 means that the user's logon information will still be in the cache, even if a member of the IT department has recently logged on to their computer to perform system maintenance. This method allows users to log on to their computers when they are not connected to the organization's network.

Default Value:

The recommended state for this setting is: User is prompted when the key is first used. Configuring this setting to User must enter a password each time they use a key also conforms to the benchmark.

Rationale:

If a user's account is compromised or their computer is inadvertently left unsecured the malicious user can use the keys stored for the user to access protected resources. You can configure this policy setting so that users must provide a password that is distinct from their domain password every time they use a key. This configuration makes it more difficult for an attacker to access locally stored user keys, even if the attacker takes control of the user's computer and determines their logon password."

Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security Options\System cryptography: Force strong key protection for user keys stored on the computer

Impact:

Users will have to enter their password the first time they access a key that is stored on their computer. For example, if users use an S-MIME certificate to digitally sign their e-mail they will be forced to enter the password for that certificate the first time that they send a signed e-mail message. For even stronger security, the value User must enter a password each time they use a key can be set, but the overhead that is involved using this configuration may be too high for some organizations.

Microsoft does not recommend enforcing this setting on servers due to the significant impact on manageability. For example, you may not be able to configure Remote Desktop Services to use SSL certificates. More information is available in the Windows PKI TechNet Blog here: What is a strong key protection in Windows?.

IPv6 allows for many more IP addresses to be assigned than IPv4 did. Older networking, hosts and operating systems may not support IPv6 natively.

The recommended state for this setting is: DisabledComponents - 0xff (255)

Rationale:

Since the vast majority of private enterprise managed networks have no need to utilize IPv6 (because they have access to private IPv4 addressing), disabling IPv6 components removes a possible attack surface that is also harder to monitor the traffic on. As a result, we recommend configuring IPv6 to a Disabled state when it is not needed."
      solution    : "To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Registry value to 0xff (255) (DWORD):

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TCPIP6\Parameters:DisabledComponents

Note: This change does not take effect until the computer has been restarted.
Note #2: Although Microsoft does not provide an ADMX template to configure this registry value, a custom .ADM template (Disable-IPv6-Components-KB929852.adm) is provided in the CIS Benchmark Remediation Kit to facilitate its configuration. Be aware though that simply turning off the group policy setting in the .ADM template will not 'undo' the change once applied. Instead, the opposite setting must be applied to change the registry value to the opposite state.

Impact:

Connectivity to other systems using IPv6 will no longer operate, and software that depends on IPv6 will cease to function. Examples of Microsoft applications that may use IPv6 include: Remote Assistance, HomeGroup, DirectAccess, Windows Mail.

This registry change is documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base article 929852: How to disable IPv6 or its components in Windows.

Note: This registry change does not take effect until the next reboot.

Default Value:

All IPv6 components are enabled and Windows prefers IPv6 over IPv4."

{7ebefbc0-3200-11d2-b4c2-00a0C9697d07} - IEEE 1394 devices that support the IEC-61883 Protocol Class

{c06ff265-ae09-48f0-812c-16753d7cba83} - IEEE 1394 devices that support the AVC Protocol Class

{6bdd1fc1-810f-11d0-bec7-08002be2092f} - IEEE 1394 Host Bus Controller Class

The full list of system-defined device setup classes available in Windows is here: System-Defined Device Setup Classes Available to Vendors | Microsoft Docs

The recommended state for this setting is: {d48179be-ec20-11d1-b6b8-00c04fa372a7}, {7ebefbc0-3200-11d2-b4c2-00a0C9697d07}, {c06ff265-ae09-48f0-812c-16753d7cba83}, and {6bdd1fc1-810f-11d0-bec7-08002be2092f}

Note: IEEE 1394 has also been known/branded as FireWire (by Apple), i.LINK (by Sony) and Lynx (by Texas Instruments).

Rationale:

A BitLocker-protected computer may be vulnerable to Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks when the computer is turned on or is in the Standby power state - this includes when the workstation is locked.

BitLocker with TPM-only authentication lets a computer enter the power-on state without any pre-boot authentication. Therefore, an attacker may be able to perform DMA attacks.

This issue is documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base article 2516445: Blocking the SBP-2 driver and Thunderbolt controllers to reduce 1394 DMA and Thunderbolt DMA threats to BitLocker."

      info        : "This policy setting allows you to configure whether or not enhanced startup PINs are used with BitLocker.

Enhanced startup PINs permit the use of characters including uppercase and lowercase letters, symbols, numbers, and spaces. This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

Rationale:

A numeric-only PIN provides less entropy than a PIN that is alpha-numeric. When not using enhanced PIN for startup, BitLocker requires the use of the function keys [F1-F10] for PIN entry since the PIN is entered in the pre-OS environment before localization support is available. This limits each PIN digit to one of ten possibilities. The TPM has an anti-hammering feature that includes a mechanism to exponentially increase the delay for PIN retry attempts; however, an attacker is able to more effectively mount a brute force attack using a domain of 10 digits of the function keys."

Impact:

Disabled. (Enhanced PINs will not be used.)"

      info        : "This policy setting allows you to configure whether Secure Boot will be allowed as the platform integrity provider for BitLocker operating system drives.

Secure Boot ensures that the PC's pre-boot environment only loads firmware that is digitally signed by authorized software publishers. Secure Boot also provides more flexibility for managing pre-boot configuration than legacy BitLocker integrity checks.

Secure Boot requires a system that meets the UEFI 2.3.1 Specifications for Class 2 and Class 3 computers.

When this policy is enabled and the hardware is capable of using Secure Boot for BitLocker scenarios, the 'Use enhanced Boot Configuration Data validation profile' group policy setting is ignored and Secure Boot verifies BCD settings according to the Secure Boot policy setting, which is configured separately from BitLocker.

Note: If the group policy setting 'Configure TPM platform validation profile for native UEFI firmware configurations' is enabled and has PCR 7 omitted, BitLocker will be prevented from using Secure Boot for platform or Boot Configuration Data (BCD) integrity validation.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

Rationale:

Secure Boot ensures that only firmware digitally signed by authorized software publishers is loaded during computer startup, which reduces the risk of rootkits and other types of malware from gaining control of the system. It also helps provide protection against malicious users booting from an alternate operating system."

Rationale:

Should a user lose their primary means for accessing an encrypted OS volume, or should the system not pass its boot time integrity checks, the system will go into recovery mode. If the recovery key has not been backed up to Active Directory, the user would need to have saved the recovery key to another location such as a USB flash drive, or have printed the recovery password, and now have access to one of those in order to recovery the system.

This means that you will not be able to specify which recovery option to use when you enable BitLocker, instead BitLocker recovery options for the drive are determined by the policy setting.

In 'Save BitLocker recovery information to Active Directory Domain Services' choose which BitLocker recovery information to store in AD DS for removable data drives. If you select 'Backup recovery password and key package', both the BitLocker recovery password and key package are stored in AD DS. If you select 'Backup recovery password only', only the recovery password is stored in AD DS.

Select the 'Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for removable data drives' check box if you want to prevent users from enabling BitLocker unless the computer is connected to the domain and the backup of BitLocker recovery information to AD DS succeeds.

Note: If the 'Do not enable BitLocker until recovery information is stored in AD DS for removable data drives' check box is selected, a recovery password is automatically generated.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.
