ASP.NET provides a session state, which is available as the HttpSessionState class, as a method of storing session-specific information that is visible only within the session.

This option gives the administrator the ability to use standard query tools, or create custom tools, for viewing real-time logging information in ETW.

The cookie will contain the session identifier (ID) and may contain authentication data to the hosted application. To protect this data from easily being compromised, the cookie must be encrypted.

When a cookie is sent encrypted via SSL/TLS, an attacker must spend a great deal of time and resources to decrypt the cookie. If, along with encryption, the cookie is compressed, the attacker can now use a combination of plaintext injection and inadvertent information leakage through data compression to reduce the time needed to decrypt the cookie. This attack is called Compression Ratio Info-leak Made Easy (CRIME).

Cookies shared between the web server and the client when encrypted should not also be compressed.

A cookie can be read by client-side scripts easily if cookie properties are not set properly. By allowing cookies to be read by the client-side scripts, information such as session identifiers could be compromised and used by an attacker who intercepts the cookie. Setting cookie properties (i.e. HttpOnly property) to disallow client-side scripts from reading cookies better protects the information inside the cookie.

The cookie will contain the session identifier (ID) and may contain authentication data to the hosted application. To protect this data from easily being compromised, the cookie must be encrypted.

When a cookie is sent encrypted via SSL/TLS, an attacker must spend a great deal of time and resources to decrypt the cookie. If, along with encryption, the cookie is compressed, the attacker can now use a combination of plaintext injection and inadvertent information leakage through data compression to reduce the time needed to decrypt the cookie. This attack is called Compression Ratio Info-leak Made Easy (CRIME).

Cookies shared between the web server and the client when encrypted should not also be compressed.

A cookie can be read by client-side scripts easily if cookie properties are not set properly. By allowing cookies to be read by the client-side scripts, information such as session identifiers could be compromised and used by an attacker who intercepts the cookie. Setting cookie properties (i.e. HttpOnly property) to disallow client-side scripts from reading cookies better protects the information inside the cookie.

An example of this would be an SMTP queue. This queue may be added to a web server through an SMTP module to enhance error reporting or to allow developers to add SMTP functionality to their applications.

Any modules used by the web server that queue data before transmission must maintain the confidentiality and integrity of the information before the data is transmitted.

Information can be either unintentionally or maliciously disclosed or modified during reception, including, for example, during aggregation, at protocol transformation points, and during packing/unpacking. These unauthorized disclosures or modifications compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the information.

Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of received information requires that application servers take measures to employ approved cryptography in order to protect the information during transmission over the network.

CGI, represented by all upper case letters, should not be confused with the .cgi file extension. The .cgi file extension does represent a CGI script, but CGI scripts may be written in a number of programming languages (e.g., PERL, C, PHP, and JavaScript), each having their own unique file extension.

The use of CGI scripts represent one of the most common and exploitable means of compromising a web server. By definition, CGI scripts are executable by the operating system of the host server. While access control is provided via the web service, the execution of CGI programs is not limited unless the SA or the Web Manager takes specific measures. CGI programs can access and alter data files, launch other programs, and use the network.
