Because the task scheduler is often used for administrative purposes, it may be needed in enterprise environments.

However, its use should be restricted in high security environments to prevent misuse of system resources or to prevent attackers from using the right to launch malicious code after gaining user level access to a computer.

 The recommended state for this setting is: 'Administrators'.

 Rationale:

 The 'Log on as a batch job' user right presents a low-risk vulnerability.

For most organizations, the default settings are sufficient."
      solution    : "To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 'Administrators':


Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights Assignment\Log on as a batch job


Impact:

If you configure the 'Log on as a batch job' setting through domain-based Group Policies, the computer will not be able to assign the user right to accounts that are used for scheduled jobs in the Task Scheduler.

If you install optional components such as ASP.NET or IIS, you might need to assign this user right to additional accounts that are required by those components.

For example, IIS requires assignment of this user right to the 'IIS_WPG' group and the 'IUSR_'_(ComputerName)_, 'ASPNET', and 'IWAM_'_(ComputerName)_ accounts.

If this user right is not assigned to this group and these accounts, IIS will be unable to run some COM objects that are necessary for proper functionality."

This user right should be restricted on any computer in a high security environment, but because many applications may require this privilege, it should be carefully evaluated and tested before configuring it in an enterprise environment.

On Windows Vista-based (and newer) computers, no users or groups have this privilege by default.

 The recommended state for this setting is: 'No One'.

 Rationale:

 'Log on as a service' is a powerful user right because it allows accounts to launch network services or services that run continuously on a computer, even when no one is logged on to the console.

The risk is reduced by the fact that only users with administrative privileges can install and configure services.

An attacker who has already attained that level of access could configure the service to run with the 'Local System' account."

This security setting determines who is allowed to install a printer driver as part of connecting to a shared printer.

 The recommended state for this setting is: 'Enabled'.

 Note: This setting does not affect the ability to add a local printer.

This setting does not affect Administrators.

 Rationale:

 It may be appropriate in some organizations to allow users to install printer drivers on their own workstations.

However, in a high security environment, you should allow only Administrators, not users, to do this, because printer driver installation may unintentionally cause the computer to become less stable.

A malicious user could install inappropriate printer drivers in a deliberate attempt to damage the computer, or a user might accidentally install malicious software that masquerades as a printer driver.

It is feasible for an attacker to disguise a Trojan horse program as a printer driver.

The program may appear to users as if they must use it to print, but such a program could unleash malicious code on your computer network."

      info        : "Ensure 'Interactive logon: Number of previous logons to cache (in case domain controller is not available)' is set to '4 or fewer logon(s)'

This policy setting determines whether a user can log on to a Windows domain using cached account information.

Logon information for domain accounts can be cached locally to allow users to log on even if a Domain Controller cannot be contacted.

This policy setting determines the number of unique users for whom logon information is cached locally.

If this value is set to 0, the logon cache feature is disabled.

An attacker who is able to access the file system of the server could locate this cached information and use a brute force attack to determine user passwords.

 The recommended state for this setting is: '4 or fewer logon(s)'.

 Rationale:

 The number that is assigned to this policy setting indicates the number of users whose logon information the computer will cache locally.

If the number is set to 4, then the computer caches logon information for 4 users.

When a 5th user logs on to the computer, the server overwrites the oldest cached logon session.

 Users who access the computer console will have their logon credentials cached on that computer.

An attacker who is able to access the file system of the computer could locate this cached information and use a brute force attack to attempt to determine user passwords.

To mitigate this type of attack, Windows encrypts the information and obscures its physical location."
      solution    : "To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to '4 or fewer logon(s)':


 Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security Options\Interactive logon: Number of previous logons to cache (in case domain controller is not available)


 Impact:

 Users will be unable to log on to any computers if there is no Domain Controller available to authenticate them.

Organizations may want to configure this value to 2 for end-user computers, especially for mobile users.

A configuration value of 2 means that the user's logon information will still be in the cache, even if a member of the IT department has recently logged on to their computer to perform system maintenance.

This method allows users to log on to their computers when they are not connected to the organization's network."

      info        : "Ensure 'System cryptography: Force strong key protection for user keys stored on the computer' is set to 'User is prompted when the key is first used' or higher

This policy setting determines whether users' private keys (such as their S-MIME keys) require a password to be used.

 The recommended state for this setting is: 'User is prompted when the key is first used'.

Configuring this setting to 'User must enter a password each time they use a key' also conforms to the benchmark.

 Rationale:

 If a user's account is compromised or their computer is inadvertently left unsecured the malicious user can use the keys stored for the user to access protected resources.

You can configure this policy setting so that users must provide a password that is distinct from their domain password every time they use a key.

This configuration makes it more difficult for an attacker to access locally stored user keys, even if the attacker takes control of the user's computer and determines their logon password."
      solution    : "To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 'User is prompted when the key is first used' (configuring to ''User must enter a password each time they use a key'' also conforms to the benchmark):


 Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security Options\System cryptography: Force strong key protection for user keys stored on the computer


 Impact:

 Users will have to enter their password the first time they access a key that is stored on their computer.

For example, if users use an S-MIME certificate to digitally sign their e-mail they will be forced to enter the password for that certificate the first time that they send a signed e-mail message.

For even stronger security, the value 'User must enter a password each time they use a key' can be set, but the overhead that is involved using this configuration may be too high for some organizations.

 Microsoft does not recommend enforcing this setting on servers due to the significant impact on manageability.

For example, you may not be able to configure Remote Desktop Services to use SSL certificates.

This setting is used to enable or disable the Internet Router Discovery Protocol (IRDP), which allows the system to detect and configure default gateway addresses automatically as described in RFC 1256 on a per-interface basis.

 The recommended state for this setting is: 'Disabled'.

 Rationale:

 An attacker who has gained control of a computer on the same network segment could configure a computer on the network to impersonate a router.

Other computers with IRDP enabled would then attempt to route their traffic through the already compromised computer."

 Impact:

 Windows will not automatically detect and configure default gateway addresses on the computer."

      info        : "Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is a set of protocols that computers use to exchange information over the Internet and over home and business networks.

IPv6 allows for many more IP addresses to be assigned than IPv4 did.

Older networking, hosts and operating systems may not support IPv6 natively.

 The recommended state for this setting is: 'DisabledComponents - 0xff (255)'

 Rationale:

 Since the vast majority of private enterprise managed networks have no need to utilize IPv6 (because they have access to private IPv4 addressing), disabling IPv6 components reduces a possible attack surface that is also harder to monitor the traffic on.

As a result, we recommend configuring IPv6 to a Disabled state when it is not needed."
      solution    : "To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Registry value to '0xff (255) (DWORD)':


 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TCPIP6\Parameters:DisabledComponents


 Note: This change does not take effect until the computer has been restarted.

 'Note #2:' Although Microsoft does not provide an ADMX template to configure this registry value, a custom .ADM template ('Disable-IPv6-Components-KB929852.adm') is provided in the CIS Benchmark Remediation Kit to facilitate its configuration.

Be aware though that simply turning off the group policy setting in the .ADM template will not 'undo' the change once applied.

Instead, the opposite setting must be applied to change the registry value to the opposite state.

 Impact:

 Connectivity to other systems using IPv6 will no longer operate, and software that depends on IPv6 will cease to function.

Examples of Microsoft applications that may use IPv6 include: Remote Assistance, HomeGroup, DirectAccess, Windows Mail.

 This registry change is documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base article 929852: [How to disable IPv6 or its components in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929852).

 Note: This registry change does not take effect until the next reboot."
