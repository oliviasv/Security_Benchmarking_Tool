      info        : "This security setting determines the number of failed logon attempts that causes the machine to be locked out.

Failed password attempts against workstations or member servers that have been locked using either CTRL+ALT+DELETE or password protected screen savers counts as failed logon attempts.

The machine lockout policy is enforced only on those machines that have BitLocker enabled for protecting OS volumes. Please ensure that appropriate recovery password backup policies are enabled.

The recommended state for this setting is: 10 or fewer invalid logon attempts, but not 0.

Note: A value of 0 does not conform to the benchmark as it disables the machine account lockout threshold. Values from 1 to 3 will be interpreted as 4.

Rationale:

If a machine is lost or stolen, or if an insider threat attempts a brute force password attack against the computer, it is important to ensure that BitLocker will lock the computer and therefore prevent a successful attack."

Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security Options\Interactive logon: Machine account lockout threshold

Impact:

Users will be able to mistype their password several times, but the machine account will be locked out if a brute force password attack occurs. A locked out machine can only be recovered by providing the BitLocker recovery key at the console.

Default Value:

0 invalid logon attempts. (The machine will never lock out.)"

If you enable this policy setting, Windows is prevented from installing a device whose hardware ID or compatible ID appears in the list you create. If you enable this policy setting on a remote desktop server, the policy setting affects redirection of the specified devices from a remote desktop client to the remote desktop server.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, devices can be installed and updated as allowed or prevented by other policy settings.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

Note: In versions of Windows 10 Release 1803 (and newer), there is a new control named Enumeration policy for external devices incompatible with Kernel DMA Protection available that mitigates much of the risk for malicious devices that may perform Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks. The newer control is also now part of the Windows 10 CIS benchmark, in section 18.8.26. However, if your environment still contains any Windows 10 Release 1709 (or older) workstations, then the newer control will not work, so this setting remains important to disable Thunderbolt devices on those systems.

Rationale:

A BitLocker-protected computer may be vulnerable to Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks when the computer is turned on or is in the Standby power state - this includes when the workstation is locked.

BitLocker with TPM-only authentication lets a computer enter the power-on state without any pre-boot authentication. Therefore, an attacker may be able to perform DMA attacks.

The recommended state for this setting is: PCI\CC_0C0A

Note: This device ID is for Thunderbolt controllers. The USB Type-C (USB-C) port standard that is now common in many computers, especially laptops, utilizes Thunderbolt technology, and therefore may be affected by this restriction. If your organization needs to use USB-C extensively, you may need to decide, internally, to allow yourselves an exception to this recommendation. However, please ensure that all necessary decision-makers have accepted the increased risk of BitLocker encryption key theft (and therefore data theft) via malicious Thunderbolt devices (when left unattended), by doing so.

      info        : "This policy is intended to provide additional security against external DMA-capable devices. It allows for more control over the enumeration of external DMA-capable devices that are not compatible with DMA Remapping/device memory isolation and sandboxing.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: Block All.

Note: This policy does not apply to 1394, PCMCIA or ExpressCard devices. The protection also only applies to Windows 10 R1803 or higher, and also requires a UEFI BIOS to function.

Note #2: More information on this feature is available at this link: Kernel DMA Protection for Thunderbolt 3 (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs.

Rationale:

Device memory sandboxing allows the OS to leverage the I/O Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) of a device to block unpermitted I/O, or memory access, by the peripheral."

Note: This Group Policy path may not exist by default. It is provided by the Group Policy template DmaGuard.admx/adml that is included with the Microsoft Windows 10 Release 1809 & Server 2019 Administrative Templates (or newer).

Impact:

External devices that are not compatible with DMA-remapping will not be enumerated and will not function unless/until the user has logged in successfully and has an unlocked user session. Once enumerated, these devices will continue to function, regardless of the state of the session. Devices that are compatible with DMA-remapping will be enumerated immediately, with their device memory isolated.

Default Value:

Windows 10 R1803 and newer: Enabled if UEFI BIOS is present. Disabled if using legacy BIOS.

Older OSes: Not supported (i.e. Disabled)."

      info        : "This policy setting allows you to configure whether Secure Boot will be allowed as the platform integrity provider for BitLocker operating system drives.

Secure Boot ensures that the PC's pre-boot environment only loads firmware that is digitally signed by authorized software publishers. Secure Boot also provides more flexibility for managing pre-boot configuration than legacy BitLocker integrity checks.

Secure Boot requires a system that meets the UEFI 2.3.1 Specifications for Class 2 and Class 3 computers.

When this policy is enabled and the hardware is capable of using Secure Boot for BitLocker scenarios, the 'Use enhanced Boot Configuration Data validation profile' group policy setting is ignored and Secure Boot verifies BCD settings according to the Secure Boot policy setting, which is configured separately from BitLocker.

Note: If the group policy setting 'Configure TPM platform validation profile for native UEFI firmware configurations' is enabled and has PCR 7 omitted, BitLocker will be prevented from using Secure Boot for platform or Boot Configuration Data (BCD) integrity validation.

The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

Rationale:

Secure Boot ensures that only firmware digitally signed by authorized software publishers is loaded during computer startup, which reduces the risk of rootkits and other types of malware from gaining control of the system. It also helps provide protection against malicious users booting from an alternate operating system."

If you want to use BitLocker on a computer without a TPM, select the 'Allow BitLocker without a compatible TPM' check box.

When the USB key is inserted the access to the drive is authenticated and the drive is accessible. If the USB key is lost or unavailable you will need to use one of the BitLocker recovery options to access the drive.

On a computer with a compatible TPM, four types of authentication methods can be used at startup to provide added protection for encrypted data. When the computer starts, it can use only the TPM for authentication, or it can also require insertion of a USB flash drive containing a startup key, the entry of a 4-digit to 20-digit personal identification number (PIN), or both.

      info        : "This policy setting allows you to manage BitLocker's use of hardware-based encryption on removable data drives and specify which encryption algorithms it can use with hardware-based encryption. Using hardware-based encryption can improve performance of drive operations that involve frequent reading or writing of data to the drive.

You can specify additional options that control whether BitLocker software-based encryption is used instead of hardware-based encryption on computers that do not support hardware-based encryption and whether you want to restrict the encryption algorithms and cipher suites used with hardware-based encryption.

Note: The 'Choose drive encryption method and cipher strength' policy setting does not apply to hardware-based encryption. The encryption algorithm used by hardware-based encryption is set when the drive is partitioned. By default, BitLocker uses the algorithm configured on the drive to encrypt the drive. The 'Restrict encryption algorithms and cipher suites allowed for hardware-based encryption' option enables you to restrict the encryption algorithms that BitLocker can use with hardware encryption. If the algorithm set for the drive is not available, BitLocker will disable the use of hardware-based encryption.

Encryption algorithms are specified by object identifiers (OID). For example:

AES 128 in CBC mode OID: 2.16.840.1.101.3.4.1.2

AES 256 in CBC mode OID: 2.16.840.1.101.3.4.1.42
