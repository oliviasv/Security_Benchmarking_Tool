the Microsoft Outlook Calendar Sharing Service.
If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from three levels of detail-. All options are available - This level of detail is the default configuration.

. Disables 'Full details'

. Disables 'Full details' and 'Limited details'

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook users can share their
calendars with selected others by publishing them to the Microsoft Outlook Calendar
Sharing Service. Users can choose from three levels of detail-. Availability only - Authorized visitors will see the user's time marked as Free, Busy,
Tentative, or Out of Office, but will not be able to see the subjects or details of
calendar items.

. Limited details - Authorized visitors can see the user's availability and the subjects
of calendar items only. They will not be able to view the details of calendar items.
Optionally, users can allow visitors to see the existence of private items.

. Full details - Authorized visitors can see the full details of calendar items. Optionally,
users can allow visitors to see the existence of private items. The recommended
state for this setting is- Enabled-Disables 'Full details' and 'Limited
details'.

*Rationale*

By default, Outlook 2010 users can share their calendars with selected others by publishing
them to the Microsoft Office Outlook Calendar Sharing Service. Users can choose from three
levels of detail-

. Availability only. Authorized visitors will see the user's time marked as Free, Busy,
Tentative, or Out of Office, but will not be able to see the subjects or details of
calendar items.

. Limited details. Authorized visitors can see the user's availability and the subjects of
calendar items only. They will not be able to view the details of calendar items.
Optionally, users can allow visitors to see the existence of private items.

. Full details. Authorized visitors can see the full details of calendar items. Optionally,
users can allow visitors to see the existence of private items and to access
attachments within calendar items.If users are allowed to publish limited or full details, sensitive information in their
calendars could become exposed to parties who are not authorized to have that
information."

calendar details users can publish\Restrict level of calendar details users can
publish

Then set the Restrict level of calendar details users can publish option to
Disables 'Full details' and 'Limited details'.

Impact-Choosing Disables 'Full details' or Disables 'Full details' and 'Limited details' could cause
disruptions for Outlook 2010 users who rely on the ability to publish details of their
appointments to the Microsoft Office Outlook Calendar Sharing Service. These users will
have to communicate appointment details to outside parties by other means."

      info                 : "This policy setting controls whether hyperlinks in suspected phishing e-mail messages in
Outlook are allowed.
If you enable this policy setting, Outlook will allow hyperlinks in suspected phishing
messages that are not also classified as junk e-mail.
If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook will not allow hyperlinks in
suspected phishing messages, even if they are not classified as junk e-mail. The
recommended state for this setting is- Disabled.

*Rationale*

Outlook 2010's Junk E-mail Filter evaluates each incoming message for possible spam or
phishing content. Suspicious message detection is always turned on.By default, Outlook handles suspicious messages in two ways-. If the Junk E-mail Filter does not consider a message to be spam but does consider it
to be phishing, the message is left in the Inbox but any links in the message are
disabled and users cannot use the Reply and Reply All functionality. In addition, any
attachments in the suspicious message are blocked.

If the Junk E-mail Filter considers the message to be both spam and phishing, the
message is automatically sent to the Junk E-mail folder. Any message sent to the
Junk E-mail folder is converted to plain text format and all links are disabled. In
addition, the Reply and Reply All functionality is disabled and any attachments in
the message are blocked.The InfoBar alerts users to this change in functionality. If users are certain that a message is
legitimate, they can click the InfoBar and enable the links in the message.Users can change the way Outlook handles phishing messages in the Junk E-mail Options
dialog box by clearing the Disable links and other functionality in phishing messages
(Recommended) check box. If this check box is cleared, Outlook will not disable links in
suspected phishing messages unless they are classified as junk e-mail, which could allow
users to disclose confidential information to malicious Web sites."

*Rationale*

Malicious e-mail senders can send HTML e-mail messages with embedded Web beacons, or
pictures and other content from external servers that can be used to track whether specific
recipients have opened a message. Viewing an e-mail message that contains a Web beacon
provides confirmation that the recipient's e-mail address is valid, which leaves the
recipient vulnerable to additional spam and harmful e-mail. To help protect users from
Web beacons, Outlook 2010 can be configured to automatically block the display of
external content in e-mail messages. However, because this configuration could block
desirable content from display, Outlook can also be configured to automatically display
external content in any messages sent by people who are listed in users' Safe Senders Lists
or Safe Recipients Lists.
By default, Outlook 2010 automatically displays external content in e-mail messages from
people listed in users' Safe Senders Lists or Safe Recipients Lists, and automatically blocks
external content in other messages. If a malicious sender is accidentally added to a user's
Safe Senders List or Safe Recipients List, Outlook will display external content in all e-mail
messages from the malicious sender, which could include Web beacons."

Impact-Disabling this setting means that Outlook 2010 does not automatically download external
content for messages sent by people listed in users' Safe Senders Lists or Safe Recipients
Lists. This configuration can cause some disruption for users who regularly receive HTML

are sent from Outlook. If you enable this policy setting, text is automatically wrapped in
Internet e-mail messages and attachments are encoded in UUENCODE format. If you
disable this policy setting, Outlook uses the standard MIME format to encode attachments
in plain text Outlook messages. Users will not be able to change this configuration. If you do

*Rationale*

If outgoing mail is formatted in certain ways, for example if attachments are encoded in
UUENCODE format, attackers might manipulate the messages for their own purposes. If
UUENCODE formatting is used, an attacker could manipulate the encoded attachment to
bypass content filtering software. By default, Outlook 2010 automatically wraps plain text
messages at 76 characters and uses the standard MIME format to encode attachments in
plain text messages. However, these settings can be altered to allow e-mail to be read in
plain text e-mail programs that use a non-standard line length or that cannot process MIME
attachments."

Many RSS feeds use messages that contain a brief summary of a larger message or an
article with a link to the full content. Users can configure Outlook 2010 to automatically
download the linked content as message attachments for individual RSS feeds. If a feed is
frequently updated or typically contains very large messages and is not AutoArchived

*Rationale*

If outgoing mail is formatted in certain ways, for example if attachments are encoded in
UUENCODE format, attackers might manipulate the messages for their own purposes. If
UUENCODE formatting is used, an attacker could manipulate the encoded attachment to
bypass content filtering software. By default, Outlook 2010 automatically wraps plain text

*Rationale*

Malicious code is often spread through e-mail. Some viruses have the ability to send copies
of themselves to other people in the victim's Address Book or Contacts list, and such
potentially harmful files can affect the computers of unwary recipients.
Outlook 2010 uses two levels of security to restrict users' access to files attached to e-mail
messages or other items. Files with specific extensions can be categorized as Level 1 (users
cannot view the file) or Level 2 (users can open the file after saving it to disk). Users can
freely open files of types that are not categorized as Level 1 or Level 2.
By default, Outlook classifies a number of potentially harmful file types as Level 1. (See
Attachment file types restricted by Outlook 2010 for the complete list.) Outlook does not
classify any file types as Level 2 by default, so this setting is not particularly useful in
isolation. Typically, if there are extensions on the Level 2 list they would have been added
by using the 'Add file extensions to block as Level 2' setting, through which they can be
removed.
The combined lists of blocked and restricted file extensions that Outlook uses are actually
built by combining various policies together. If a machine policy classifies an extension as
Level 2, this setting could be used to remove the extension from the list in some situations.
As with Level 1 extensions, though, removing restrictions on potentially dangerous
extensions can make it easier for users to open dangerous files, which can significantly
reduce security."

If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from four options for handling macros in
Outlook-

 Always warn. This option corresponds to the 'Warnings for all macros' option in the
'Macro Security' section of the Outlook Trust Center. Outlook disables all macros
that are not opened from a trusted location, even if the macros are signed by a
trusted publisher. For each disabled macro, Outlook displays a security alert dialog
box with information about the macro and its digital signature (if present), and
allows users to enable the macro or leave it disabled.

Never warn, disable all. This option corresponds to the 'No warnings and disable all
macros' option in the Trust Center. Outlook disables all macros that are not opened
from trusted locations, and does not notify users.

Warning for signed, disable unsigned. This option corresponds to the 'Warnings for
signed macros; all unsigned macros are disabled' option in the Trust Center.
Outlook handles macros as follows-

o If a macro is digitally signed by a trusted publisher, the macro can run if the
user has already trusted the publisher.

o If a macro has a valid signature from a publisher that the user has not
trusted, the security alert dialog box for the macro lets the user choose
whether to enable the macro for the current session, disable the macro for
the current session, or to add the publisher to the Trusted Publishers list so
that it will run without prompting the user in the future.

o If a macro does not have a valid signature, Outlook disables it without
prompting the user, unless it is opened from a trusted location.

This option is the default configuration in Outlook.. No security check. This option corresponds to the 'No security check for macros
(Not recommended)' option in the Trust Center. Outlook runs all macros without
prompting users. This configuration makes users' computers vulnerable to
potentially malicious code and is not recommended.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the behavior is the equivalent of

Enabled-Never warn, disable all.

*Rationale*

To protect users from dangerous code, the Outlook 2010 default configuration disables all
macros that are not trusted, including unsigned macros, macros with expired or invalid
signatures, and macros with valid signatures from publishers who are not on users'
Trusted Publishers lists. The default configuration also allows macros that are signed by

requests, Outlook prompts them to decide whether to send a receipt to the sender with

*Rationale*

Incoming signed or encrypted messages might include S/MIME receipt requests. S/MIME
receipts provide confirmation that messages are received unaltered, and can include
information about who opened the message and when it was opened. By default, when
users open messages with attached receipt requests, Outlook 2010 prompts them to decide
whether to send a receipt to the sender with information about the identity of the user who
opened the message and the time it was opened. If Outlook cannot send the receipt, the
user is still allowed to open the message. In some situations, allowing Outlook to
automatically send receipt requests could cause sensitive information to be divulged to
unauthorized people."

requests to users affected by this setting will not receive the requested S/MIME receipts,

certificates issued by the CA can also be trusted. If Outlook cannot find the root certificate,
it cannot validate that any certificates issued by that CA can be trusted. An attacker may

*Rationale*

Cryptographic keys are used to encrypt and decrypt messages for transmission through
unsecured channels. Key sizes are measured in bits, with larger keys generally less
vulnerable to attack than smaller ones. 40-bit and 56-bit keys were common in the past,
but as computers have become faster and more powerful these smaller key sizes have
become vulnerable to brute-force attacks in which the attacking computer rapidly runs
through every possible key combination until it successfully decrypts the message. The
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) published by the United States government requires
a minimum key size of 128 bits for symmetric encryption, which offers significantly more
protection against brute-force attack than smaller key sizes."

This policy setting controls what happens when an untrusted program attempts to
programmatically send e-mail in Outlook using the Response method of a task or meeting
request.
If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from four different options when an
untrusted program attempts to programmatically send e-mail using the Response method
of a task or meeting request-

. Prompt user. The user will be prompted to approve every access attempt.

. Automatically approve. Outlook will automatically grant programmatic access
requests from any program. This option can create a significant vulnerability, and is
not recommended.

. Automatically deny. Outlook will automatically deny programmatic access requests
from any program.

. Prompt user based on computer security. Outlook only prompts users when
antivirus software is out of date or not running. This is the default configuration.
If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, when an untrusted application
attempts to respond to tasks or meeting requests programmatically, Outlook relies on the
setting configured in the 'Programmatic Access' section of the Trust Center. This setting
determines whether Outlook will warn users about programmatic access attempts-
- Only when antivirus software is out of date or not running (the default setting)
- Every time
- Not at all. If the 'Not at all' option is selected, Outlook will silently grant programmatic
access to any program that requests it.
Note - This described default functionality assumes that you have not followed the
recommendation to enable the 'Outlook Security Mode' Group Policy setting to ensure that
Outlook security settings are configured by Group Policy. If Group Policy security settings
are used for Outlook, the 'Programmatic Access' section of the Trust Center is not used. In
this situation, the default is to prompt users based on computer security, which is the
equivalent of the 'Only when antivirus software is out of date or not running' option in the
Trust Center, and the user experience is not affected.

attempts to use the object model to obtain e-mail address information, store data outside of
Outlook, execute certain actions, and send e-mail messages. To reduce excessive security
warnings when add-ins are used, administrators can specify a list of trusted add-ins that

      info                 : "This policy setting allows you to control how ActiveX controls in UserForms should be
initialized based upon whether they are Safe For Initialization (SFI) or Unsafe for
Initialization (UFI).
ActiveX controls are Component Object Model (COM) objects and have unrestricted access
to users' computers. ActiveX controls can access the local file system and change the
registry settings of the operating system. If a malicious user repurposes an ActiveX control
to take over a user's computer, the effect could be significant. To help improve security,
ActiveX developers can mark controls as Safe For Initialization (SFI), which means that the
developer states that the controls are safe to open and run and not capable of causing harm
to any computers. If a control is not marked SFI, the control could adversely affect a
computer or it's possible the developers did not test the control in all situations and are
not sure whether their control might be compromised at some future date.SFI controls run
in safe mode, which limits their access to the computer. For example, a worksheet control
can both read and write files when it is in unsafe mode, but perhaps only read from files
when it is in safe mode. This functionality allows the control to be used in very powerful
ways when safety wasn't important, but the control would still be safe for use in a Web
page. If a control is not marked as SFI, it is marked Unsafe For Initialization (UFI), which
means that it is capable of affecting a user's computer. If UFI ActiveX controls are loaded,
they are always loaded in unsafe mode.
If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from four options for loading controls in
UserForms-

1. For a UFI or SFI signed control that supports safe and unsafe mode, load the control
in unsafe mode. For an SFI signed control that only supports a safe mode
configuration, load the control in safe mode. This option enforces the default
configuration.
2. Users are prompted to determine how UserForm forms will load. The prompt only
displays once per session within an application. When users respond to the prompt,
loading continues based on whether the control is UFI or SFI-

o For a UFI signed control, if users respond Yes to the prompt, load the control
in unsafe mode. If users respond No, load the control using the default
properties.

o For an SFI signed control that supports both safe and unsafe modes, if users
respond Yes to the prompt, load the control in unsafe mode. If users respond
No, load the control using safe mode. If the SFI control can only support safe
mode, load the control in safe mode. This option is the default configuration
in the Microsoft Office 2010 release.3. Users are prompted to determine how UserForm forms will load. The prompt only
displays once per session within an application. When users respond to the prompt,
loading continues based on whether the control is UFI or SFI-

o For a UFI signed control, if users respond Yes to the prompt, load the control
in unsafe mode. If users respond No, load the control with its default
properties.

o For an SFI signed control, load in safe mode.4. For a UFI signed control, load with the default properties of the control. For an SFI
signed control, load in safe mode (considered to be the safest mode).If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the behavior is as if you enable this
policy setting and then select option 1.

http-//officeredir.microsoft.com/r/rlidGPSecSettingsActXCtrlO14?clid=1033 The
recommended state for this setting is- Disabled.

*Rationale*

ActiveX controls are Component Object Model (COM) objects and have unrestricted access
to users' computers. ActiveX controls can access the local file system and change the
registry settings of the operating system. If a malicious user repurposes an ActiveX control
to take over a user's computer, the effect could be significant.To help improve security, ActiveX developers can mark controls as Safe For Initialization
(SFI), which means that the developer states that the controls are safe to open and run and
not capable of causing harm to any computers. If a control is not marked SFI, the control
could adversely affect a computer or it's possible the developers did not test the control
in all situations and are not sure whether their control might be compromised at some
future date.SFI controls run in safe mode, which limits their access to the computer. For example, a
worksheet control can both read and write files when it is in unsafe mode, but perhaps only
read from files when it is in safe mode. This functionality allows the control to be used in
very powerful ways when safety wasn't important, but the control would still be safe for
use in a Web page.
If a control is not marked as SFI, it is marked Unsafe For Initialization (UFI), which means
that it is capable of affecting a user's computer. If UFI ActiveX controls are loaded, they are
always loaded in unsafe mode.This setting allows administrators to control how ActiveX controls in UserForms should be
initialized based upon whether they are SFI or UFI."

If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from four options for enforcing Outlook
security settings-. Outlook Default Security - This option is the default configuration in Outlook. Users
can configure security themselves, and Outlook ignores any security-related settings
configured in Group Policy.

. Use Security Form from 'Outlook Security Settings' Public Folder - Outlook uses the
settings from the security form published in the designated public folder.

. Use Security Form from 'Outlook 10 Security Settings' Public Folder - Outlook uses
the settings from the security form published in the designated public folder.
. Use Outlook Security Group Policy - Outlook uses security settings from Group

Policy.Important- You must enable this policy setting if you want to apply the other Outlook
security policy settings mentioned in this baseline.
If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook users can configure security
for themselves, and Outlook ignores any security-related settings that are configured in
Group Policy.

Note- In previous versions of Outlook, when security settings were published in a form in
Exchange Server public folders, users who needed these settings required the
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Security\CheckAdminSettings
registry key to be set on their computers for the settings to apply. In Outlook, the
CheckAdminSettings registry key is no longer used to determine users' security settings.
Instead, the Outlook Security Mode setting can be used to determine whether Outlook
security should be controlled directly by Group Policy, by the security form from the
Outlook Security Settings Public Folder, or by the settings on users' own computers. The
recommended state for this setting is- Enabled-Use Outlook Security Group Policy.

*Rationale*

*Rationale*

Disabling this setting allows websites to present file download prompts via code without
the user specifically initiating the download. User preferences may also allow the download
to occur without prompting or interacting with the user. Even if Internet Explorer prompts
the user to accept the download, some websites abuse this functionality. Malicious
websites may continually prompt users to download a file or present confusing dialog
boxes to trick users into downloading or running a file.
If the download occurs and it contains malicious code, the code could become active on
user computers or the network."

Impact-User initiated downloads can still occur so the majority of legitimate user download
interactions remain unaffected. Hiding website-initiated prompt messages makes it
impossible for a malicious website to initiate a download by itself. Such a site can no longer
confuse a user into downloading a file that could then open on the user's computer to
execute an attack.However, some valid websites may initiate file downloads. If this setting is enabled, users
cannot view download prompts, and remain unaware when a download is available. If such
sites reside in an organization's intranet, they should display a link to prompt users to
initiate valid downloads if the automatic download process does not occur. This type of
functionality is already in common use on many major internet sites and should not
confuse users.
It is possible that some advanced users may expect their user preferences to control this
behavior, and for this reason, they may be confused when this preference is overridden by
this setting."

      description          : "6.17 Set 'Warn before switching dial- up connection' to 'Enabled:True'"
      info                 : "This policy setting determines how Outlook connects to dial-up accounts.
If you enable this policy setting, you can choose one or more of three options for Outlook-. Warn before switching an existing dial-up connection - Outlook displays a warning
message before a user switches to a connection other than the existing dial-up
connection. If this option is not selected, no switch will occur.

. Hang up when finished sending, receiving, or updating - Outlook automatically
disconnects after the user finishes a manual Send/Receive action.

. Automatically dial during a background Send/Receive - Outlook dials automatically
when it performs a background Send/Receive. Outlook will send and receive e-mail
messages without opening a dialog box and allows the user to continue using
Outlook features during the Send/Receive action.If you disable this policy setting, users will not be allowed to switch to a connection other
than the existing dial-up connection.
If you do not configure this policy setting, the behavior is the equivalent of enabling this
policy setting and selecting the option- Warn before switching an existing dial-up
connection. The recommended state for this setting is- Enabled-True.

*Rationale*

By default, users can connect to their e-mail servers using dial-up networking if their
accounts are configured appropriately. Dial-up connections are often used by mobile users
who need to connect to the Internet from remote locations. Remote connections are
generally not subject to the same restrictions as enterprise network environments, which
can make them more vulnerable to attack."
      solution             : "To implement the recommended configuration state, set the following Group Policy setting
to Enabled.

User Configuration\Administrative Templates\Microsoft Outlook 2010\Outlook
Options\Mail Setup\Dial-up options\Dial-up options

Then set the Warn before switching dial-up connection option to True.

Impact-The recommended setting is Enabled, with Warn before switching an existing dial-up
connection and Hang up when finished sending, receiving, or updating checked. This
configuration is intended to minimize the amount of time a user's computer spends on a
dial-up connection unnecessarily, and to ensure that the computer does not go or stay
online without the user's knowledge. It is unlikely to cause usability issues for most users."
