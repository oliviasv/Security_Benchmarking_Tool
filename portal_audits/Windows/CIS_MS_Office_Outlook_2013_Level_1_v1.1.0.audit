  description          : "1.1.2.3 Ensure 'Authentication with Exchange server.' is set to 'Enabled:Kerberos/NTLM Password Authentication'"
  info                 : "This policy setting controls which authentication method Outlook uses to authenticate with Microsoft Exchange Server. Note - Exchange Server supports the Kerberos authentication protocol and NTLM for authentication. The Kerberos protocol is the more secure authentication method and is supported on Windows 2000 Server and later versions. NTLM authentication is supported in pre-Windows 2000 environments.

If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from three different options for controlling how Outlook authenticates with Microsoft Exchange Server:
- Kerberos/NTLM password authentication. Outlook attempts to authenticate using the Kerberos authentication protocol. If this attempt fails, Outlook attempts to authenticate using NTLM. This option is the default configuration.
- Kerberos password authentication. Outlook attempts to authenticate using the Kerberos protocol only.
- NTLM password authentication. Outlook attempts to authenticate using NTLM only.
If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook will attempt to authenticate using the Kerberos authentication protocol. If it cannot (because no Windows 2000 or later domain controllers are available), it will authenticate using NTLM. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled:Kerberos/NTLM Password Authentication.

NOTE: When connecting to Office 365, this setting must be set to DISABLED.

Rationale:

Exchange Server supports the Kerberos authentication protocol and NTLM for authentication. The Kerberos protocol is the more secure authentication method and is supported on Windows 2000 Server and later versions. NTLM authentication is supported in pre-Windows 2000 environments.
By default, Outlook will attempt to authenticate using the Kerberos authentication protocol. If it cannot (because no Windows 2000 or later domain controllers are available), it will authenticate using NTLM."

Impact:

The recommended value for this setting in the Microsoft baselines enforces the default configuration, and is therefore unlikely to cause significant usability issues for most users."

The user can change the address to configure a different account, or click Next to use the default settings from Active Directory. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

Rationale:

By default, if a user is joined to a domain in an Active Directory environment and does not have an e-mail account configured, Outlook populates the e-mail address field of the New Account Wizard with the primary SMTP address of the user who is currently logged on to Active Directory. The user can change the address to configure a different account, or click Next to use the default settings from Active Directory.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, RPC encryption is still used by default. This setting allows you to override the corresponding per-profile setting. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.

Rationale:

By default, the remote procedure call (RPC) communication channel between an Outlook client computer and an Exchange server is not encrypted. If a malicious person is able to eavesdrop on the network traffic between Outlook and the server, they might be able to access confidential information."

Rationale:

Many RSS feeds use messages that contain a brief summary of a larger message or an article with a link to the full content. Users can configure Outlook to automatically download the linked content as message attachments for individual RSS feeds.

The Common Feed List is a hierarchical set of RSS Feeds to which clients such as Outlook, the Feeds list in Internet Explorer 7, and the Feed Headlines Sidebar gadget in Windows Vista can subscribe.
If you enable this policy setting, Outlook automatically subscribes to RSS Feeds added in Internet Explorer, and Outlook RSS Feeds are synchronized with the Common Feed List so they are available in Internet Explorer.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook maintains its own list of RSS Feeds and does not automatically subscribe to RSS Feeds that are added to the Common Feed List. The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

Rationale:

The Common Feed list is a hierarchical set of RSS feeds to which clients such as Outlook , the Feeds list in Internet Explorer 7, and the Feed Headlines Sidebar gadget in Windows Vista can subscribe.
If Outlook subscribes to a very large feed list, performance and availability can be affected, especially if Outlook is configured to download full RSS message bodies or if the feed list is not AutoArchived regularly.

Rationale:

If users are able to manually enter the addresses of servers that are not approved by the organization, they could use servers that do not meet your organization's information security requirements, which could cause sensitive information to be at risk.

* Unknown Signature Algorithm
* No Signing Certification Found
* Bad Attribute Sets
* No Issuer Certificate found
* No CRL Found
* Out-of-date CRL
* Root Trust Problem
* Out-of-date CTL

The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

Rationale:

Cryptographic errors in Outlook are classified as Level 1 (serious errors) or Level 2 (not as serious). By default, Outlook generates a warning, rather than an error, when a level 2 condition occurs: the certificate that generated the warning is treated as valid, and the user is not informed of the problem unless he or she opens the Signature Details dialog box and examines the certificate. Potential level 2 conditions include the following:

* Unknown Signature Algorithm
* No Signing Certification Found
* Bad Attribute Sets
* No Issuer Cert found
* No CRL Found
* Out of Date CRL
* Root Trust Problem
* Out of Date CRT

In some cases, treating level 2 conditions as warnings can cause users to overlook potentially significant signature problems."

Rationale:

E-mail typically travels over open networks and is passed from server to server. Messages are therefore vulnerable to interception, and attackers might read or alter their contents. It is therefore important to have a mechanism for signing messages and providing end-to-end encryption.
Outlook supports three formats for encrypting and signing messages: S/MIME, Exchange, and Fortezza. By default, Outlook only uses S/MIME to encrypt and sign messages.

The user can still choose to ignore the warning and send using the encryption key originally chosen. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled:168.

Rationale:

Cryptographic keys are used to encrypt and decrypt messages for transmission through unsecured channels. Key sizes are measured in bits, with larger keys generally less vulnerable to attack than smaller ones. 40-bit and 56-bit keys were common in the past, but as computers have become faster and more powerful these smaller key sizes have become vulnerable to brute-force attacks in which the attacking computer rapidly runs through every possible key combination until it successfully decrypts the message.

By default, Outlook classifies a number of potentially harmful file types as Level 1. (See Attachment file types restricted by Outlook for the complete list.) Outlook does not classify any file types as Level 2 by default, so this setting is not particularly useful in isolation. Typically, if there are extensions on the Level 2 list they would have been added by using the 'Add file extensions to block as Level 2' setting, through which they can be removed.
The combined lists of blocked and restricted file extensions that Outlook uses are actually built by combining various policies together. If a machine policy classifies an extension as Level 2, this setting could be used to remove the extension from the list in some situations. As with Level 1 extensions, though, removing restrictions on potentially dangerous extensions can make it easier for users to open dangerous files, which can significantly reduce security."

To reduce excessive security warnings when add-ins are used, administrators can specify a list of trusted add-ins that can access the Outlook object model silently, without raising prompts.

  info                 : "This policy setting controls what happens when an untrusted program attempts to gain access to an Address Book using the Outlook object model.

If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from four different options when an untrusted program attempts to programmatically access an Address Book using the Outlook object model:

- Prompt user - Users are prompted to approve every access attempt.

- Automatically approve - Outlook will automatically grant programmatic access requests from any program. This option can create a significant vulnerability, and is not recommended.

- Automatically deny - Outlook will automatically deny programmatic access requests from any program.

- Prompt user based on computer security - Outlook will rely on the setting in the ''Programmatic Access'' section of the Trust Center. This is the default behavior.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, when an untrusted application attempts to access the address book programmatically, Outlook relies on the setting configured in the ''Programmatic Access'' section of the Trust Center. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled:Automatically Deny.

Rationale:

If an untrusted application accesses the address book, the application could gain access to sensitive data and potentially change that data.

By default, when an untrusted application attempts to access the address book programmatically, Outlook relies on the setting configured in the 'Programmatic Access' section of the Trust Center. This setting determines whether Outlook will warn users about programmatic access attempts:

* Only when antivirus software is out of date or not running (the default setting)
* Every time
* Not at all

If the 'Not at all' option is selected, Outlook will silently grant programmatic access to any program that requests it, which could allow a malicious program to gain access to sensitive information.

Note: This described default functionality assumes that you have not followed the recommendation to enable the 'Outlook Security Mode' Group Policy setting to ensure that Outlook security settings are configured by Group Policy. If Group Policy security settings are used for Outlook, the 'Programmatic Access' section of the Trust Center is not used. In this situation, the default is to prompt users based on computer security, which is the equivalent of the 'Only when antivirus software is out of date or not running' option in the Trust Center, and the user experience is not affected."

If you enable this policy setting, Outlook will allow hyperlinks in suspected phishing messages that are not also classified as junk e-mail.
If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, Outlook will not allow hyperlinks in suspected phishing messages, even if they are not classified as junk e-mail. The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.

Rationale:

Outlooks Junk E-mail Filter evaluates each incoming message for possible spam or phishing content. Suspicious message detection is always turned on.

By default, Outlook handles suspicious messages in two ways:

* If the Junk E-mail Filter does not consider a message to be spam but does consider it to be phishing, the message is left in the Inbox but any links in the message are disabled and users cannot use the Reply and Reply All functionality. In addition, any attachments in the suspicious message are blocked.
* If the Junk E-mail Filter considers the message to be both spam and phishing, the message is automatically sent to the Junk E-mail folder. Any message sent to the Junk E-mail folder is converted to plain text format and all links are disabled. In addition, the Reply and Reply All functionality is disabled and any attachments in the message are blocked.

The InfoBar alerts users to this change in functionality. If users are certain that a message is legitimate, they can click the InfoBar and enable the links in the message.

Users can change the way Outlook handles phishing messages in the Junk E-mail Options dialog box by clearing the Disable links and other functionality in phishing messages (Recommended) check box. If this check box is cleared, Outlook will not disable links in suspected phishing messages unless they are classified as junk e-mail, which could allow users to disclose confidential information to malicious Web sites."

  info                 : "This policy setting controls the security level for macros in Outlook.
If you enable this policy setting, you can choose from four options for handling macros in Outlook:

* Always warn. This option corresponds to the 'Warnings for all macros' option in the 'Macro Security' section of the Outlook Trust Center. Outlook disables all macros that are not opened from a trusted location, even if the macros are signed by a trusted publisher. For each disabled macro, Outlook displays a security alert dialog box with information about the macro and its digital signature (if present), and allows users to enable the macro or leave it disabled.
* Never warn, disable all. This option corresponds to the 'No warnings and disable all macros' option in the Trust Center. Outlook disables all macros that are not opened from trusted locations, and does not notify users.

* Warning for signed, disable unsigned. This option corresponds to the 'Warnings for signed macros; all unsigned macros are disabled' option in the Trust Center. Outlook handles macros as follows:

* If a macro is digitally signed by a trusted publisher, the macro can run if the user has already trusted the publisher.
* If a macro has a valid signature from a publisher that the user has not trusted, the security alert dialog box for the macro lets the user choose whether to enable the macro for the current session, disable the macro for the current session, or to add the publisher to the Trusted Publishers list so that it will run without prompting the user in the future.
* If a macro does not have a valid signature, Outlook disables it without prompting the user, unless it is opened from a trusted location.

This option is the default configuration in Outlook.

* No security check. This option corresponds to the 'No security check for macros (Not recommended)' option in the Trust Center. Outlook runs all macros without prompting users. This configuration makes users' computers vulnerable to potentially malicious code and is not recommended.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting, the behavior is the equivalent of Enabled -- Warning for signed, disable unsigned. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled:Never warn, disable all.

Rationale:

To protect users from dangerous code, the Outlook default configuration disables all macros that are not trusted, including unsigned macros, macros with expired or invalid signatures, and macros with valid signatures from publishers who are not on users' Trusted Publishers lists. The default configuration also allows macros that are signed by trusted publishers to run automatically without notifying users, which could allow dangerous code to run."
