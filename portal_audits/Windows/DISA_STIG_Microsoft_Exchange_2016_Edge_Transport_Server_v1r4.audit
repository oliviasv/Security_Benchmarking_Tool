Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement.

Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system.

This requirement is applicable to access control enforcement applications (e.g., authentication servers) and other applications that perform information and system access control functions.

The higher the level of detail, the more disk space required to store the audit material.

Diagnostic logging is intended to help administrators debug problems with their systems, not as a general-purpose auditing tool.

The Global Deny list blocks messages originating from specific sources. Most blacklist filtering is done using a commercial Block List service, because eliminating threats from known spammers prevents the messages being evaluated inside the enclave where there is more risk they can do harm.

Additional sources should also be blocked to supplement the contents of the commercial Block List service. For example, during a zero-day threat action, entries can be added and then removed when the threat is mitigated. An additional best practice is to enter the enterprise's home domains in the Deny List, because inbound email with a 'from' address of the home domain is very likely to be spoofed spam.

By analyzing and disabling unneeded services, the associated open ports become unresponsive to outside queries, and servers become more secure as a result.

Exchange Server has role-based server deployment to enable protocol path control and logical separation of network traffic types.

For example, a server implemented in the Client Access role (i.e., Outlook Web App [OWA]) is configured and tuned as a web server using web protocols. A client access server exposes only web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS), enabling system administrators to optimize the protocol path and disable all services unnecessary for Exchange web services.

Similarly, servers created to host mailboxes are dedicated to that task and must operate only the services needed for mailbox hosting. (Exchange servers must also operate some web services, but only to the degree that Exchange requires the IIS engine in order to function).

Because POP3 and IMAP4 clients are not included in the standard desktop offering, they must be disabled.
