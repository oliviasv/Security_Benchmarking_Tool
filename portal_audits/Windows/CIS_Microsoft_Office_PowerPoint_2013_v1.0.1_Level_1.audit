The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.  PowerPoint users can share and reuse slide content by storing individual slide files in a centrally located Slide Library on a server running Office SharePoint Server. Using the Slide Update feature, users can associate a slide in a presentation on a user's computer with the original slide that resides in the Slide Library on the server. By default, each time users open a presentation that contains a shared slide, PowerPoint notifies them if the slide has been updated and provides them with the opportunity to ignore the update, append a new slide to the outdated slide, or replace the outdated slide with the updated one. In some situations, updating a slide in a presentation from an external source like a Slide Library can cause important information to be lost. An attacker could modify the data in the slide library, affecting the integrity of all slide presentations that depend upon that library."

By default, PowerPoint ignores this flag when opening a file, and always displays any markup present in the file.

In addition, PowerPoint enables or disables the Show Markup option according to the way the flag is set when it opens files, which means that a presentation saved with hidden markup is opened with the markup still hidden.
