Windows Vista and later versions of Windows allow audit policy to be managed in a more precise way using audit policy subcategories.  Setting audit policy at the category level will override the new subcategory audit policy feature.  Group Policy only allows audit policy to be set at the category level, and existing group policy may override the subcategory settings of new machines as they are joined to the domain or upgraded to Windows Vista or later versions.  To allow audit policy to be managed using subcategories without requiring a change to Group Policy, there is a new registry value in Windows Vista and later versions, SCENoApplyLegacyAuditPolicy, which prevents the application of category-level audit policy from Group Policy and from the Local Security Policy administrative tool.

If the category level audit policy set here is not consistent with the events that are currently being generated, the cause might be that this registry key is set.

This security setting determines whether the system shuts down if it is unable to log security events.

If this security setting is enabled, it causes the system to stop if a security audit cannot be logged for any reason. Typically, an event fails to be logged when the security audit log is full and the retention method that is specified for the security log is either Do Not Overwrite Events or Overwrite Events by Days.

If the security log is full and an existing entry cannot be overwritten, and this security option is enabled, the following Stop error appears:

STOP: C0000244 {Audit Failed}
An attempt to generate a security audit failed.
To recover, an administrator must log on, archive the log (optional), clear the log, and reset this option as desired. Until this security setting is reset, no users, other than a member of the Administrators group will be able to log on to the system, even if the security log is not full.

Note: On Windows versions prior to Windows Vista configuring this security setting, changes will not take effect until you restart Windows.

This security setting determines whether all secure channel traffic initiated by the domain member must be signed or encrypted.

When a computer joins a domain, a computer account is created.

If this policy is disabled, then encryption and signing of all secure channel traffic is negotiated with the Domain Controller in which case the level of signing and encryption depends on the version of the Domain Controller and the settings of the following two policies:

Domain member: Digitally encrypt secure channel data (when possible)
Domain member: Digitally sign secure channel data (when possible)

Default: Enabled.

Notes:

If this policy is enabled, the policy Domain member: Digitally sign secure channel data (when possible) is assumed to be enabled regardless of its current setting. This ensures that the domain member attempts to negotiate at least signing of the secure channel traffic.

      info        : "Impersonate a client after authentication

Assigning this privilege to a user allows programs running on behalf of that user to impersonate a client. Requiring this user right for this kind of impersonation prevents an unauthorized user from convincing a client to connect (for example, by remote procedure call (RPC) or named pipes) to a service that they have created and then impersonating that client, which can elevate the unauthorized user's permissions to administrative or system levels.

Caution

Assigning this user right can be a security risk. Only assign this user right to trusted users.

Default:

Administrators
Local Service
Network Service
Service

Note: By default, services that are started by the Service Control Manager have the built-in Service group added to their access tokens. Component Object Model (COM) servers that are started by the COM infrastructure and that are configured to run under a specific account also have the Service group added to their access tokens. As a result, these services get this user right when they are started.

In addition, a user can also impersonate an access token if any of the following conditions exist.

The access token that is being impersonated is for this user.
The user, in this logon session, created the access token by logging on to the network with explicit credentials.
The requested level is less than Impersonate, such as Anonymous or Identify.
Because of these factors, users do not usually need this user right.

For more information, search for 'SeImpersonatePrivilege' in the Microsoft Platform SDK.

If you enable this setting, programs that previously had the Impersonate privilege may lose it, and they may not run."

      info        : "Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always)

This security setting determines whether packet signing is required by the SMB client component.

The server message block (SMB) protocol provides the basis for Microsoft file and print sharing and many other networking operations, such as remote Windows administration. To prevent man-in-the-middle attacks that modify SMB packets in transit, the SMB protocol supports the digital signing of SMB packets. This policy setting determines whether SMB packet signing must be negotiated before further communication with an SMB server is permitted.

If this setting is enabled, the Microsoft network client will not communicate with a Microsoft network server unless that server agrees to perform SMB packet signing. If this policy is disabled, SMB packet signing is negotiated between the client and server.

Default: Disabled.

Important

For this policy to take effect on computers running Windows 2000, client-side packet signing must also be enabled. To enable client-side SMB packet signing, set Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (if server agrees).
Computers that have this policy set will not be able to communicate with computers that do not have server-side packet signing enabled. By default, server-side packet signing is enabled only on domain controllers running Windows 2000 and later.
Server-side packet signing can be enabled on computers running Windows 2000 and later by setting Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (if client agrees)
Server-side packet signing can be enabled on computers running Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 and later by setting the following registry value to 1:
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanManServer\Parameters\EnableSecuritySignature

Server-side packet signing cannot be enabled on computers running Windows 95 or Windows 98.

Notes

All Windows operating systems support both a client-side SMB component and a server-side SMB component. To take advantage of SMB packet signing, both the client-side SMB component and server-side SMB component that are involved in a communication must have SMB packet signing either enabled or required. On Windows 2000 and later operating systems, enabling or requiring packet signing for client and server-side SMB components is controlled by the following four policy settings:
Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always) - Controls whether or not the client-side SMB component requires packet signing.
Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (if server agrees) - Controls whether or not the client-side SMB component has packet signing enabled.
Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always) - Controls whether or not the server-side SMB component requires packet signing.
Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (if client agrees) - Controls whether or not the server-side SMB component has packet signing enabled.
If server-side SMB signing is required, a client will not be able to establish a session with that server, unless it has client-side SMB signing enabled. By default, client-side SMB signing is enabled on workstations, servers, and domain controllers. Similarly, if client-side SMB signing is required, that client will not be able to establish a session with servers that do not have packet signing enabled. By default, server-side SMB signing is enabled only on domain controllers.
If server-side SMB signing is enabled, SMB packet signing will be negotiated with clients that have client-side SMB signing enabled.
Using SMB packet signing can impose up to a 15 percent performance hit on file service transactions."

This policy setting determines whether the SMB client component attempts to negotiate SMB packet signing when it connects to an SMB server.

If this setting is enabled, the Microsoft network client will ask the server to perform SMB packet signing upon session setup. If packet signing has been enabled on the server, packet signing will be negotiated. If this policy is disabled, the SMB client will never negotiate SMB packet signing.

Default: Enabled.

Notes

All Windows operating systems support both a client-side SMB component and a server-side SMB component. To take advantage of SMB packet signing, both the client-side SMB component and server-side SMB component that are involved in a communication must have SMB packet signing either enabled or required. On Windows 2000 and later, enabling or requiring packet signing for client and server-side SMB components is controlled by the following four policy settings:
Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always) - Controls whether or not the client-side SMB component requires packet signing.
Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (if server agrees) - Controls whether or not the client-side SMB component has packet signing enabled.
Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always) - Controls whether or not the server-side SMB component requires packet signing.
Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (if client agrees) - Controls whether or not the server-side SMB component has packet signing enabled.
If server-side SMB signing is required, a client will not be able to establish a session with that server unless it has client-side SMB signing enabled. By default, client-side SMB signing is enabled on workstations, servers, and domain controllers.
Similarly, if client-side SMB signing is required, that client will not be able to establish a session with servers that do not have packet signing enabled. By default, server-side SMB signing is enabled only on domain controllers.
If server-side SMB signing is enabled, SMB packet signing will be negotiated with clients that have client-side SMB signing enabled.
Using SMB packet signing can degrade performance up to 15 percent on file service transactions."

This security setting determines how network logons that use local accounts are authenticated. If this setting is set to Classic, network logons that use local account credentials authenticate by using those credentials. The Classic model allows fine control over access to resources. By using the Classic model, you can grant different types of access to different users for the same resource.

If this setting is set to Guest only, network logons that use local accounts are automatically mapped to the Guest account. By using the Guest model, you can have all users treated equally. All users authenticate as Guest, and they all receive the same level of access to a given resource, which can be either Read-only or Modify.

Default on domain computers: Classic.
Default on stand-alone computers: Guest only

Important

With the Guest only model, any user who can access your computer over the network (including anonymous Internet users) can access your shared resources. You must use the Windows Firewall or another similar device to protect your computer from unauthorized access. Similarly, with the Classic model, local accounts must be password protected; otherwise, those user accounts can be used by anyone to access shared system resources.

Note:

This setting does not affect interactive logons that are performed remotely by using such services as Telnet or Remote Desktop Services.  Remote Desktop Services was called Terminal Services in previous versions of Windows Server.

This security setting determines if digital certificates are processed when a user or process attempts to run software with an .exe file name extension. This security settings is used to enable or disable certificate rules, a type of software restriction policies rule. With software restriction policies, you can create a certificate rule that will allow or disallow software that is signed by Authenticode to run, based on the digital certificate that is associated with the software. In order for certificate rules to take effect, you must enable this security setting.

When certificate rules are enabled, software restriction policies will check a certificate revocation list (CRL) to make sure the software's certificate and signature are valid. This may decrease performance when start signed programs. You can disable this feature. On Trusted Publishers Properties, clear the Publisher and Timestamp check boxes.

This security setting controls whether User Interface Accessibility (UIAccess or UIA) programs can automatically disable the secure desktop for elevation prompts being used by a standard user.

If you enable this setting, UIA programs including Windows Remote Assistance can automatically disable the secure desktop for elevation prompts. Unless you have also disabled elevation prompts, the prompts will appear on the interactive user's desktop instead of the secure desktop.

If you disable or do not configure this setting, the secure desktop can only be disabled by the user of the interactive desktop or by disabling the 'User Account Control: Switch to the secure desktop when prompting for elevation' setting.

UIA programs are designed to interact with Windows and application programs on behalf of a user. This setting allows UIA programs to bypass the secure desktop to increase usability in certain cases, but allowing elevation requests to appear on the regular interactive desktop instead of the secure desktop increases your security risk.

Since UIA programs must be able to respond to prompts regarding security issues, such as the UAC elevation prompt, UIA programs must be highly trusted. In order to be considered trusted, a UIA program must be digitally signed. By default, UIA programs can be run only from the following protected paths:
..\Program Files\ (and subfolders)
..\Program Files (x86)\ (and subfolders, in 64-bit versions of Windows only)
..\Windows\System32\

The requirement to be in a protected path can be disabled by the 'User Account Control: Only elevate UIAccess applications that are installed in secure locations' setting.

While this setting applies to any UIA program, it will be used primarily in certain Windows Remote Assistance scenarios. The Windows Remote Assistance program in Windows Vista is a UIA program.

If a user requests remote assistance from an administrator and the remote assistance session is established, any elevation prompts appear on the interactive user's secure desktop and the administrator's remote session is paused. To avoid pausing the remote administrators session during elevation requests, ,the user may select the 'Allow IT Expert to respond to User Account Control prompts' check box when setting up the remote assistance session. However, selecting this check box itself requires  that the interactive user respond to an elevation prompt on the secure desktop. If the interactive user is a standard user, the user does not have the required credentials to allow elevation.

If you enable this setting, ('User Account Control: Allow UIAccess applications to prompt for elevation without using the secure desktop'), , requests for elevation are automatically sent to the interactive desktop (not the secure desktop) and also appear on the remote administrator's view of the desktop during a Windows Remote Assistance session, and the remote administrator is able to provide the appropriate credentials for elevation.

This setting does not change the behavior of the UAC elevation prompt for administrators.

If you plan to enable this setting, you should also review the effect of the 'User Account Control: Behavior of the elevation prompt for standard users' setting. If it is configured as 'Automatically deny elevation requests' elevation requests will not be presented to the user."
