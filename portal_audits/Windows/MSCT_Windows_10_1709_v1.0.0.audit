Disabling the Administrator account can become a maintenance issue under certain circumstances.

This security setting determines whether local accounts that are not password protected can be used to log on from locations other than the physical computer console. If enabled, local accounts that are not password protected will only be able to log on at the computer's keyboard.

Default: Enabled.


Warning:

Computers that are not in physically secure locations should always enforce strong password policies for all local user accounts. Otherwise, anyone with physical access to the computer can log on by using a user account that does not have a password. This is especially important for portable computers.
If you apply this security policy to the Everyone group, no one will be able to log on through Remote Desktop Services.

Notes

This setting does not affect logons that use domain accounts.
It is possible for applications that use remote interactive logons to bypass this setting.

Note: Remote Desktop Services was called Terminal Services in previous versions of Windows Server."

This user right allows a process to impersonate any user without authentication. The process can therefore gain access to the same local resources as that user.

Processes that require this privilege should use the LocalSystem account, which already includes this privilege, rather than using a separate user account with this privilege specially assigned. If your organization only uses servers that are members of the Windows Server 2003 family, you do not need to assign this privilege to your users. However, if your organization uses servers running Windows 2000 or Windows NT 4.0, you might need to assign this privilege to use applications that exchange passwords in plaintext.

Assigning this user right can be a security risk. Only assign this user right to trusted users.

If you disable or do not configure this policy setting the security features of Windows Installer prevent users from changing installation options typically reserved for system administrators such as specifying the directory to which files are installed.

If Windows Installer detects that an installation package has permitted the user to change a protected option it stops the installation and displays a message. These security features operate only when the installation program is running in a privileged security context in which it has access to directories denied to the user.

This policy setting is designed for less restrictive environments. It can be used to circumvent errors in an installation program that prevents software from being installed."

If you enable this policy setting privileges are extended to all programs.

Local accounts are at high risk for credential theft when the same account and password is configured on multiple systems.  Enabling this policy significantly reduces that risk.

Enabled (recommended): Applies UAC token-filtering to local accounts on network logons. Membership in powerful group such as Administrators is disabled and powerful privileges are removed from the resulting access token. This configures the LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy registry value to 0. This is the default behavior for Windows.

Disabled: Allows local accounts to have full administrative rights when authenticating via network logon, by configuring the LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy registry value to 1.

This security setting determines whether the OS audits each instance of a user attempting to log on to or to log off to this computer.

Log off events are generated whenever a logged on user account's logon session is terminated. If this policy setting is defined, the administrator can specify whether to audit only successes, only failures, both successes and failures, or to not audit these events at all (i.e. neither successes nor failures).

      info        : "Audit: Force audit policy subcategory settings (Windows Vista or later) to override audit policy category settings.

Windows Vista and later versions of Windows allow audit policy to be managed in a more precise way using audit policy subcategories.  Setting audit policy at the category level will override the new subcategory audit policy feature.  Group Policy only allows audit policy to be set at the category level, and existing group policy may override the subcategory settings of new machines as they are joined to the domain or upgraded to Windows Vista or later versions.  To allow audit policy to be managed using subcategories without requiring a change to Group Policy, there is a new registry value in Windows Vista and later versions, SCENoApplyLegacyAuditPolicy, which prevents the application of category-level audit policy from Group Policy and from the Local Security Policy administrative tool.

If the category level audit policy set here is not consistent with the events that are currently being generated, the cause might be that this registry key is set.

This security setting determines whether all secure channel traffic initiated by the domain member must be signed or encrypted.

When a computer joins a domain, a computer account is created. After that, when the system starts, it uses the computer account password to create a secure channel with a domain controller for its domain. This secure channel is used to perform operations such as NTLM pass through authentication, LSA SID/name Lookup etc.

This setting determines whether or not all secure channel traffic initiated by the domain member meets minimum security requirements. Specifically it determines whether all secure channel traffic initiated by the domain member must be signed or encrypted. If this policy is enabled, then the secure channel will not be established unless either signing or encryption of all secure channel traffic is negotiated. If this policy is disabled, then encryption and signing of all secure channel traffic is negotiated with the Domain Controller in which case the level of signing and encryption depends on the version of the Domain Controller and the settings of the following two policies:

Domain member: Digitally encrypt secure channel data (when possible)
Domain member: Digitally sign secure channel data (when possible)

Default: Enabled.

Notes:

If this policy is enabled, the policy Domain member: Digitally sign secure channel data (when possible) is assumed to be enabled regardless of its current setting. This ensures that the domain member attempts to negotiate at least signing of the secure channel traffic.

Important

There is no known reason for disabling this setting. Besides unnecessarily reducing the potential confidentiality level of the secure channel, disabling this setting may unnecessarily reduce secure channel throughput, because concurrent API calls that use the secure channel are only possible when the secure channel is signed or encrypted.

Insecure guest logons are used by file servers to allow unauthenticated access to shared folders. While uncommon in an enterprise environment insecure guest logons are frequently used by consumer Network Attached Storage (NAS) appliances acting as file servers. Windows file servers require authentication and do not use insecure guest logons by default. Since insecure guest logons are unauthenticated important security features such as SMB Signing and SMB Encryption are disabled. As a result clients that allow insecure guest logons are vulnerable to a variety of man-in-the-middle attacks that can result in data loss data corruption and exposure to malware. Additionally any data written to a file server using an insecure guest logon is potentially accessible to anyone on the network.

      info        : "Impersonate a client after authentication

Assigning this privilege to a user allows programs running on behalf of that user to impersonate a client. Requiring this user right for this kind of impersonation prevents an unauthorized user from convincing a client to connect (for example, by remote procedure call (RPC) or named pipes) to a service that they have created and then impersonating that client, which can elevate the unauthorized user's permissions to administrative or system levels.

Caution

Assigning this user right can be a security risk. Only assign this user right to trusted users.

Default:

Administrators
Local Service
Network Service
Service

Note: By default, services that are started by the Service Control Manager have the built-in Service group added to their access tokens. Component Object Model (COM) servers that are started by the COM infrastructure and that are configured to run under a specific account also have the Service group added to their access tokens. As a result, these services get this user right when they are started.

In addition, a user can also impersonate an access token if any of the following conditions exist.

The access token that is being impersonated is for this user.
The user, in this logon session, created the access token by logging on to the network with explicit credentials.
The requested level is less than Impersonate, such as Anonymous or Identify.
Because of these factors, users do not usually need this user right.

For more information, search for 'SeImpersonatePrivilege' in the Microsoft Platform SDK.

Warning

If you enable this setting, programs that previously had the Impersonate privilege may lose it, and they may not run."

This security setting determines what happens when the smart card for a logged-on user is removed from the smart card reader.

The options are:

- No Action
- Lock Workstation
- Force Logoff
- Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session

If you click Lock Workstation in the Properties dialog box for this policy, the workstation is locked when the smart card is removed, allowing users to leave the area, take their smart card with them, and still maintain a protected session.

If you click Force Logoff in the Properties dialog box for this policy, the user is automatically logged off when the smart card is removed.

If you click Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session, removal of the smart card disconnects the session without logging the user off. This allows the user to insert the smart card and resume the session later, or at another smart card reader-equipped computer, without having to log on again. If the session is local, this policy functions identically to Lock Workstation.

Note: Remote Desktop Services was called Terminal Services in previous versions of Windows Server.

Default: This policy is not defined, which means that the system treats it as No action.

On Windows Vista and above: For this setting to work, the Smart Card Removal Policy service must be started."

Basic membership will send basic information to Microsoft about software that has been detected including where the software came from the actions that you apply or that are applied automatically and whether the actions were successful.

Advanced membership in addition to basic information will send more information to Microsoft about malicious software spyware and potentially unwanted software including the location of the software file names how the software operates and how it has impacted your computer.

      info        : "Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always)

This security setting determines whether packet signing is required by the SMB client component.

The server message block (SMB) protocol provides the basis for Microsoft file and print sharing and many other networking operations, such as remote Windows administration. To prevent man-in-the-middle attacks that modify SMB packets in transit, the SMB protocol supports the digital signing of SMB packets. This policy setting determines whether SMB packet signing must be negotiated before further communication with an SMB server is permitted.

If this setting is enabled, the Microsoft network client will not communicate with a Microsoft network server unless that server agrees to perform SMB packet signing. If this policy is disabled, SMB packet signing is negotiated between the client and server.

Default: Disabled.

Important

For this policy to take effect on computers running Windows 2000, client-side packet signing must also be enabled. To enable client-side SMB packet signing, set Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (if server agrees).
Computers that have this policy set will not be able to communicate with computers that do not have server-side packet signing enabled. By default, server-side packet signing is enabled only on domain controllers running Windows 2000 and later.
Server-side packet signing can be enabled on computers running Windows 2000 and later by setting Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (if client agrees)
Server-side packet signing can be enabled on computers running Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 and later by setting the following registry value to 1:
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanManServer\Parameters\EnableSecuritySignature

Server-side packet signing cannot be enabled on computers running Windows 95 or Windows 98.

Notes

All Windows operating systems support both a client-side SMB component and a server-side SMB component. To take advantage of SMB packet signing, both the client-side SMB component and server-side SMB component that are involved in a communication must have SMB packet signing either enabled or required. On Windows 2000 and later operating systems, enabling or requiring packet signing for client and server-side SMB components is controlled by the following four policy settings:
Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always) - Controls whether or not the client-side SMB component requires packet signing.
Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (if server agrees) - Controls whether or not the client-side SMB component has packet signing enabled.
Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always) - Controls whether or not the server-side SMB component requires packet signing.
Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (if client agrees) - Controls whether or not the server-side SMB component has packet signing enabled.
If server-side SMB signing is required, a client will not be able to establish a session with that server, unless it has client-side SMB signing enabled. By default, client-side SMB signing is enabled on workstations, servers, and domain controllers. Similarly, if client-side SMB signing is required, that client will not be able to establish a session with servers that do not have packet signing enabled. By default, server-side SMB signing is enabled only on domain controllers.
If server-side SMB signing is enabled, SMB packet signing will be negotiated with clients that have client-side SMB signing enabled.
Using SMB packet signing can impose up to a 15 percent performance hit on file service transactions."

      info        : "Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always)

This security setting determines whether packet signing is required by the SMB server component.

The server message block (SMB) protocol provides the basis for Microsoft file and print sharing and many other networking operations, such as remote Windows administration. To prevent 'man-in-the-middle' attacks that modify SMB packets in transit, the SMB protocol supports the digital signing of SMB packets. This policy setting determines whether SMB packet signing must be negotiated before further communication with an SMB client is permitted.

If this setting is enabled, the Microsoft network server will not communicate with a Microsoft network client unless that client agrees to perform SMB packet signing. If this setting is disabled, SMB packet signing is negotiated between the client and server.

Default:

Disabled for member servers.
Enabled for domain controllers.

Notes

All Windows operating systems support both a client-side SMB component and a server-side SMB component. To take advantage of SMB packet signing, both the client-side SMB component and server-side SMB component that are involved in a communication must have SMB packet signing either enabled or required. On Windows 2000 and later, enabling or requiring packet signing for client and server-side SMB components is controlled by the following four policy settings:
Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always) - Controls whether or not the client-side SMB component requires packet signing.
Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (if server agrees) - Controls whether or not the client-side SMB component has packet signing enabled.
Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always) - Controls whether or not the server-side SMB component requires packet signing.
Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (if client agrees) - Controls whether or not the server-side SMB component has packet signing enabled.
If server-side SMB signing is required, a client will not be able to establish a session with that server unless it has client-side SMB signing enabled. By default, client-side SMB signing is enabled on workstations, servers, and domain controllers.
Similarly, if client-side SMB signing is required, that client will not be able to establish a session with servers that do not have packet signing enabled. By default, server-side SMB signing is enabled only on domain controllers.
If server-side SMB signing is enabled, SMB packet signing will be negotiated with clients that have client-side SMB signing enabled.
Using SMB packet signing can degrade performance up to 15 percent on file service transactions.

Important

For this policy to take effect on computers running Windows 2000, server-side packet signing must also be enabled. To enable server-side SMB packet signing, set the following policy:
Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (if server agrees)

For Windows 2000 servers to negotiate signing with Windows NT 4.0 clients, the following registry value must be set to 1 on the Windows 2000 server:
HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\lanmanserver\parameters\enableW9xsecuritysignature

Computers that have this policy set will not communicate with computers that do not have client-side packet signing enabled. Client-side packet signing can be enabled on computers running Windows 2000 and later by setting the following policy:"

This security setting determines whether to disconnect users who are connected to the local computer outside their user account's valid logon hours. This setting affects the Server Message Block (SMB) component.

When this policy is enabled, it causes client sessions with the SMB server to be forcibly disconnected when the client's logon hours expire.

If this policy is disabled, an established client session is allowed to be maintained after the client's logon hours have expired.

Default: Enabled.

Note: This security setting behaves as an account policy. For domain accounts, there can be only one account policy. The account policy must be defined in the Default Domain Policy, and it is enforced by the domain controllers that make up the domain. A domain controller always pulls the account policy from the Default Domain Policy Group Policy object (GPO), even if there is a different account policy applied to the organizational unit that contains the domain controller. By default, workstations and servers that are joined to a domain (for example, member computers) also receive the same account policy for their local accounts. However, local account policies for member computers can be different from the domain account policy by defining an account policy for the organizational unit that contains the member computers.

None: The LDAP BIND request is issued with the options that are specified by the caller.
Negotiate signing: If Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer (TLS\SSL) has not been started, the LDAP BIND request is initiated with the LDAP data signing option set in addition to the options specified by the caller.

Require signature: This is the same as Negotiate signing. However, if the LDAP server's intermediate saslBindInProgress response does not indicate that LDAP traffic signing is required, the caller is told that the LDAP BIND command request failed.

Caution

If you set the server to Require signature, you must also set the client. Not setting the client results in a loss of connection with the server.

If you enable this policy setting all communications between clients and RD Session Host servers during remote connections must use the encryption method specified in this setting. By default the encryption level is set to High. The following encryption methods are available:* High: The High setting encrypts data sent from the client to the server and from the server to the client by using strong 128-bit encryption. Use this encryption level in environments that contain only 128-bit clients (for example clients that run Remote Desktop Connection). Clients that do not support this encryption level cannot connect to RD Session Host servers.* Client Compatible: The Client Compatible setting encrypts data sent between the client and the server at the maximum key strength supported by the client. Use this encryption level in environments that include clients that do not support 128-bit encryption.* Low: The Low setting encrypts only data sent from the client to the server by using 56-bit encryption.

If you disable or do not configure this setting the encryption level to be used for remote connections to RD Session Host servers is not enforced through Group Policy.

ImportantFIPS compliance can be configured through the System cryptography. Use FIPS compliant algorithms for encryption hashing and signing settings in Group Policy (under Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security Options.) The FIPS compliant setting encrypts and decrypts data sent from the client to the server and from the server to the client with the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140 encryption algorithms by using Microsoft cryptographic modules.
