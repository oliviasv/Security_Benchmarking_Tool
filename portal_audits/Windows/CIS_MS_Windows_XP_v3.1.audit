If you enable this policy setting, client sessions with the SMB service will be forcibly disconnected when the client's logon hours expire. If you disable this policy setting, established client sessions will be maintained after the client's logon hours expire. If you enable this policy setting you should also enable Network security: Force logoff when logon hours expire. If your organization configures logon hours for users, it makes sense to enable this policy setting.</info>

The customized run lists for Windows Vista are stored in the registry at the following locations: . HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run . HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run You can enable the Do not process the legacy run list setting to help prevent a malicious user from running a program each time Windows Vista starts, which could compromise data on the computer or cause other harm.

This policy setting differs from the Do not process the legacy run list setting in that programs on this list will run once the next time the client computer restarts and an administrator logs on. Setup and installation programs are sometimes added to this list to complete installations after a client computer restarts. If you enable this policy setting, attackers generally cannot use the run once list to launch rogue applications, which was a common method of attack in the past. A malicious user can exploit the run once list to install a program that may compromise the security of Windows Vista based client computers, however since editing this list requires administrator privileges the importance of configuring this setting is not high.</info>

You can set both values to be the same server. If you enable the Specify intranet Microsoft update service location setting, the Automatic Updates client will connect to the specified intranet Microsoft update service server (instead of Windows Update) to search for and download updates. This configuration allows end users in your organization to avoid firewall issues, and provides you with an opportunity to test updates before you deploy them.

to any process or to the kernel, which provides complete access to sensitive and critical
operating system components. Developers who are debugging their own applications do
not need to be assigned this user right; however, developers who are debugging new
system components will need it. Note Microsoft released several security updates in
October 2003 that used a version of Update.exe that required the administrator to have the
Debug programs user right. Administrators who did not have this user right were unable to
install these security updates until they reconfigured their user rights. This is not typical
behavior for operating system updates. For more information, see Knowledge Base article

*Rationale*

The Debug programs user right can be exploited to capture sensitive computer information
from system memory, or to access and modify kernel or application structures. Some attack
tools exploit this user right to extract hashed passwords and other private security
information, or to insert rootkit code. By default, the Debug programs user right is assigned
only to administrators, which helps to mitigate the risk from this vulnerability. The value of
removing this user right from members of the Administrators group is diminished by the
fact that a malicious user who has administrative privileges can bypass the

If you revoke this user right, no one will be able to debug programs. If you do revoke this
privilege from all accounts and a problem arises that requires an application to be
debugged on a production server, you can move the server to a different OU temporarily
and assign the Debug programs user right to a separate Group Policy for that OU. The
service account that is used for the cluster service needs the Debug programs privilege; if it
does not have it, Windows Clustering will fail. For additional information about how to

This policy setting allows users who do not have the Traverse Folder access permission to
pass through folders when they browse an object path in the NTFS file system or the
registry. This user right does not allow users to list the contents of a folder. When
configuring a user right in the SCM enter a comma-delimited list of accounts. Accounts can
be either local or located in Active Directory; they can be groups, users, or computers.

*Rationale*

The default configuration for the Bypass traverse checking setting is to allow all users,
including the Everyone group, to bypass traverse checking. Permissions to files and folders
are controlled though appropriate configuration of file system access control lists (ACLs),
as the ability to traverse the folder does not provide any read or write permissions to the
user. The only scenario in which the default configuration could lead to a mishap would be
if the administrator who configures permissions does not understand how this policy
setting works. For example, the administrator might expect that users who are unable to
access a folder will be unable to access the contents of any child folders. Such a situation is
unlikely, and therefore this vulnerability presents little risk."

Therefore, we recommend that you thoroughly test any changes to assignments of the
Bypass traverse checking user right before you make such changes to production systems.
In particular, IIS requires this user right to be assigned to the Network Service, Local

This policy setting specifies which users can add computer workstations to a specific
domain. For this policy setting to take effect, it must be assigned to the user as part of the
Default Domain Controller Policy for the domain. A user who has been assigned this right
can add up to 10 workstations to the domain. Users who have been assigned the Create
Computer Objects permission for an OU or the Computers container in Active Directory can
add an unlimited number of computers to the domain, regardless of whether they have
been assigned the 'Add workstations to a domain' user right. By default, all users in the
Authenticated Users group have the ability to add up to 10 computer accounts to an Active
Directory domain. These new computer accounts are created in the Computers container.
In Windows based networks, the term security principal is defined as a user, group, or
computer that is automatically assigned a security identifier to control access to resources.
In an Active Directory domain, each computer account is a full security principal with the
ability to authenticate and access domain resources. However, some organizations may
want to limit the number of computers in an Active Directory environment so that they can
consistently track, build, and manage the computers. If users are allowed to add computers
to the domain, tracking and management efforts would be hampered. Additionally, users could
perform activities that are more difficult to trace because of their ability to create
additional unauthorized domain computers. When configuring a user right in the SCM
enter a comma-delimited list of accounts. Accounts can be either local or located in Active
Directory; they can be groups, users, or computers.

*Rationale*


The 'Add workstations to domain' user right presents a moderate vulnerability. Users with
this right could add a computer to the domain that is configured in a way that violates
organizational security policies. For example, if your organization does not want its users
to have administrative privileges on their computers, a user could install Windows on his
or her computer and then add the computer to the domain. The user would know the
password for the local administrator account, and could log on with that account and then
add his or her domain account to the local Administrators group."

For organizations that have never allowed users to set up their own computers and add
them to the domain, this countermeasure will have no impact. For those that have allowed
some or all users to configure their own computers, this countermeasure will force the
organization to establish a formal process for these procedures going forward. It will not
affect existing computers unless they are removed from and re-added to the domain.

client to connect - for example, by remote procedure call (RPC) or named pipes - to a
service that they have created to impersonate that client, which could elevate the
unauthorized user's permissions to administrative or system levels. Services that are
started by the Service Control Manager have the built-in Service group added by default to
their access tokens. COM servers that are started by the COM infrastructure and configured
to run under a specific account also have the Service group added to their access tokens. As
a result, these processes are assigned this user right when they are started. Additionally, a user can
impersonate an access token if any of the following conditions exist- . The access token that
is being impersonated is for this user. . The user, in this logon session, logged on to the
network with explicit credentials to create the access token. . The requested level is less
than Impersonate, such as Anonymous or Identify. An attacker with the Impersonate a
client after authentication user right could create a service, trick a client to make them
connect to the service, and then impersonate that client to elevate the attacker's level of
access to that of the client. When configuring a user right in the SCM enter a comma
delimited list of accounts. Accounts can be either local or located in Active Directory, they
can be groups, users, or computers.

This policy setting determines which users and groups can change the time and date on the
internal clock of the computers in your environment. Users who are assigned this user right
can affect the appearance of event logs. When a computer's time setting is changed, logged
events reflect the new time, not the actual time that the events occurred. When configuring
a user right in the SCM enter a comma-delimited list of accounts. Accounts can be either
local or located in Active Directory; they can be groups, users, or computers. Note-
Discrepancies between the time on the local computer and on the domain controllers in
your environment may cause problems for the Kerberos authentication protocol, which
could make it impossible for users to log on to the domain or obtain authorization to access
domain resources after they are logged on. Additionally, problems will occur when Group Policy is
applied to client computers if the system time is not synchronized with the domain
controllers.

*Rationale*

Users who can change the time on a computer could cause several problems. For example,
time stamps on event log entries could be made inaccurate, time stamps on files and folders
that are created or modified could be incorrect, and computers that belong to a domain
may not be able to authenticate themselves or users who try to log on to the domain from
them. Additionally, because the Kerberos authentication protocol requires that the requestor and
authenticator have their clocks synchronized within an administrator-defined skew period,
an attacker who changes a computer's time may cause that computer to be unable to obtain
or grant Kerberos tickets. The risk from these types of events is mitigated on most domain
controllers, member servers, and end-user computers because the Windows Time service
automatically synchronizes time with domain controllers in the following ways- . All client
desktop computers and member servers use the authenticating domain controller as their
inbound time partner. . All domain controllers in a domain nominate the primary domain
controller (PDC) emulator operations master as their inbound time partner. . All PDC
emulator operations masters follow the hierarchy of domains in the selection of their
inbound time partner. . The PDC emulator operations master at the root of the domain is
authoritative for the organization. Therefore, it is recommended that you configure this
computer to synchronize with a reliable external time server. This vulnerability becomes
much more serious if an attacker is able to change the system time and then stop the
Windows Time service or reconfigure it to synchronize with a time server that is not
accurate."

In some organizations, it can be a daunting management challenge to maintain a regular

disable the built-in Administrator account instead of relying on regular password changes
to protect it from attack. Another reason to disable this built-in account is that it cannot be
locked out no matter how many failed logons it accrues, which makes it a prime target for
brute force attacks that attempt to guess passwords. Additionally, this account has a well-known
security identifier (SID) and there are third-party tools that allow authentication by using
the SID rather than the account name. This capability means that even if you rename the
Administrator account, an attacker could launch a brute force attack by using the SID to log

Administrator account, you must restart in safe mode to fix the problem that broke the
secure channel. If the current Administrator password does not meet the password
requirements, you will not be able to re-enable the Administrator account after it is

This policy setting determines whether packet signing is required by the SMB client
component. If you enable this policy setting, the Microsoft network client computer cannot
communicate with a Microsoft network server unless that server agrees to sign SMB
packets. In mixed environments with legacy client computers, set this option to Disabled
because these computers will not be able to authenticate or gain access to domain
controllers. However, you can use this policy setting in Windows 2000 or later
environments. Note When Windows Vista based computers have this policy setting enabled
and they connect to file or print shares on remote servers, it is important that the setting is
synchronized with its companion setting, Microsoft network server- Digitally sign
communications (always), on those servers. For more information about these settings, see
the Microsoft network client and server- Digitally sign communications (four related
settings) section in Chapter 5 of the Threats and Countermeasures guide.

*Rationale*

Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network as
the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can
potentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then forward them so that the
server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the attacker could pose as the
server or client after legitimate authentication and gain unauthorized access to data. SMB is
the resource sharing protocol that is supported by the Windows operating systems. SMB
signatures authenticate both users and the servers that host the data. If either side fails the
authentication process, data transmission will not take place."

*Impact*

The Windows 2000 and later implementations of the SMB file and print sharing protocol
support mutual authentication, which protect against session hijacking attacks and support
message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this
authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then verified by both
the client and the server. Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect
performance, because each packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings are
enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server that is
serving as a domain controller, file server, print server, and application server performance
may be substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all
unsigned SMB communications, older applications and operating systems will not be able
to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be
vulnerable to session hijacking attacks. When SMB signing policies are enabled on domain
controllers running Windows Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista
SP1 or Windows Server 2008 group policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available from
Microsoft that resolves this issue; see Microsoft Knowledgebase Article 950876 for more

*Rationale*


When a computer joins a domain, a computer account is created. After it joins the domain,
the computer uses the password for that account to create a secure channel with the
domain controller for its domain every time that it restarts. Requests that are sent on the
secure channel are authenticated - and sensitive information such as passwords are
encrypted - but the channel is not integrity-checked, and not all information is encrypted. If
a computer is configured to always encrypt or sign secure channel data but the domain
controller cannot sign or encrypt any portion of the secure channel data, the computer and
domain controller cannot establish a secure channel. If the computer is configured to
encrypt or sign secure channel data when possible, a secure channel can be established, but
the level of encryption and signing is negotiated."

*Impact*

Digital encryption and signing of the secure channel is a good idea where it is supported.
The secure channel protects domain credentials as they are sent to the domain controller.
However, only Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 6a (SP6a) and subsequent versions of
the Windows operating system support digital encryption and signing of the secure
channel. Windows 98 Second Edition clients do not support it unless they have the Dsclient
installed. Therefore, you cannot enable the Domain member- Digitally encrypt or sign
secure channel data (always) setting on domain controllers that support Windows 98
clients as members of the domain. Potential impacts can include the following- . The ability
to create or delete trust relationships with clients running versions of Windows earlier
than Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a will be disabled. . Logons from clients running versions of
Windows earlier than Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a will be disabled. . The ability to
authenticate other domains' users from a domain controller running a version of Windows
earlier than Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a in a trusted domain will be disabled. You can
enable this policy setting after you eliminate all Windows 9x clients from the domain and
upgrade all Windows NT 4.0 servers and domain controllers from trusted/trusting
domains to Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a. You can enable the other two policy settings,
Domain member- Digitally encrypt secure channel data (when possible) and Domain
member- Digitally encrypt sign channel data (when possible), on all computers in the
domain that support them and clients running versions of Windows earlier than Windows
NT 4.0 with SP6a and applications that run on these versions of Windows will not be
affected.

organization is required to be FIPS compliant. Important- This setting is recorded in
different registry locations depending upon the version of Windows being used. For
Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 it is stored at

HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\FIPSAlgorithmPolicy, with Windows Vista

or Windows Server 2008.

*Rationale*

algorithms that are available for digital encryption, hashing and signing. Use of these
algorithms will minimize the risk of compromise of digitally encrypted or signed data by an
unauthorized user."

Client computers that have this policy setting enabled will be unable to communicate by
means of digitally encrypted or signed protocols with servers that do not support these
algorithms. Network clients that do not support these algorithms will not be able to use
servers that require them for network communications. For example, many Apache-based
Web servers are not configured to support TLS. If you enable this setting, you also need to
configure Internet Explorer to use TLS. This policy setting also affects the encryption level

computers that are configured for remote control; RDP connections will fail if both
computers are not configured to use the same encryption algorithms. To enable Internet

the Advanced tab. 3. Select the Use TLS 1.0 check box. It is also possible to configure this
policy setting through Group Policy or by using the Internet Explorer Administrators Kit.
Client computers running Windows XP, Windows XP SP1 and Windows XP SP2 that try to
connect to a Terminal Services server that has this setting enabled will be unable to

This policy setting determines how network logons that use local accounts are

the ability to assign different types of access to different users for the same resource. The
Guest only option allows you to treat all users equally. In this context, all users authenticate
as Guest only to receive the same access level to a given resource.

*Rationale*

With the Guest only model, any user who can authenticate to your computer over the
network does so with guest privileges, which probably means that they will not have write
access to shared resources on that computer. Although this restriction does increase
security, it makes it more difficult for authorized users to access shared resources on those
computers because ACLs on those resources must include access control entries (ACEs) for
the Guest account. With the Classic model, local accounts should be password protected.
Otherwise, if Guest access is enabled, anyone can use those user accounts to access shared
system resources."

LAN Manager (LM) is a family of early Microsoft client/server software that allows users to
link personal computers together on a single network. Network capabilities include
transparent file and print sharing, user security features, and network administration tools.
In Active Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is the default authentication protocol.
However, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory will
use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM
version 2 (NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows
clients when they perform the following operations - . Join a domain . Authenticate between
Active Directory forests . Authenticate to down-level domains . Authenticate to computers
that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, or Windows XP) . Authenticate to
computers that are not in the domain The possible values for the Network security- LAN
Manager authentication level setting are- . Send LM & NTLM responses . Send LM & NTLM
 use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated . Send NTLM responses only . Send NTLMv2
responses only . Send NTLMv2 responses only\refuse LM . Send NTLMv2 responses
only\refuse LM & NTLM . Not Defined The Network security- LAN Manager authentication
level setting determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for
network logons. This choice affects the authentication protocol level that clients use, the
session security level that the computers negotiate, and the authentication level that
servers accept as follows- . Send LM & NTLM responses. Clients use LM and NTLM
authentication and never use NTLMv2 session security. Domain controllers accept LM,
NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Send LM & NTLM use NTLMv2 session security if
negotiated. Clients use LM and NTLM authentication and use NTLMv2 session security if
the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.
Send NTLM response only. Clients use NTLM authentication only and use NTLMv2 session
security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2
authentication. . Send NTLMv2 response only. Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and
use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM,
NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Send NTLMv2 response only\refuse LM. Clients use
NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it.
Domain controllers refuse LM (accept only NTLM and NTLMv2 authentication). . Send
NTLMv2 response only\refuse LM & NTLM. Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and
use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM and
NTLM (accept only NTLMv2 authentication). These settings correspond to the levels
discussed in other Microsoft documents as follows- . Level 0 Send LM and NTLM response;
never use NTLMv2 session security. Clients use LM and NTLM authentication, and never
use NTLMv2 session security. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2

Send NTLMv2 response only. Clients use NTLMv2 authentication, and use NTLMv2 session
security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2

authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain
controllers refuse LM authentication, that is, they accept NTLM and NTLMv2. . Level 5
Domain controllers refuse LM and NTLM responses (accept only NTLMv2). Clients use
NTLMv2 authentication, use and NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain
controllers refuse NTLM and LM authentication (they accept only NTLMv2).

*Rationale*

In Windows Vista, this setting is undefined. However, in Windows 2000, Windows Server
2003, and Windows XP clients are configured by default to send LM and NTLM
authentication responses (Windows 95-based and Windows 98-based clients only send
LM). The default setting on servers allows all clients to authenticate with servers and use
their resources. However, this means that LM responses - the weakest form of
authentication response - are sent over the network, and it is potentially possible for
attackers to sniff that traffic to more easily reproduce the user's password. The Windows
95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems cannot use the Kerberos version 5
protocol for authentication. For this reason, in a Windows Server 2003 domain, these
computers authenticate by default with both the LM and NTLM protocols for network
authentication. You can enforce a more secure authentication protocol for Windows 95,
Windows 98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the logon process, NTLMv2 uses a
secure channel to protect the authentication process. Even if you use NTLMv2 for earlier
clients and servers, Windows-based clients and servers that are members of the domain
will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to authenticate with Windows Server 2003
domain controllers."

This policy setting determines whether the SMB client will attempt to negotiate SMB packet
signing. The implementation of digital signing in Windows based networks helps to prevent

communication. Microsoft recommends to enable The Microsoft network client- Digitally
sign communications (if server agrees) setting. Note Enabling this policy setting on SMB
clients on your network makes them fully effective for packet signing with all clients and
servers in your environment.

*Rationale*

Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network as
the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can
potentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then them so that the server
might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the attacker could pose as the server or
client after legitimate authentication and gain unauthorized access to data. SMB is the
resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows operating systems. SMB
signatures authenticate both users and the servers that host the data. If either side fails the
authentication process, data transmission will not take place."

*Impact*

The Windows 2000 and later implementations of the SMB file and print sharing protocol
support mutual authentication, which protect against session hijacking attacks and support
message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this
authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then verified by both
the client and the server. Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect
performance, because each packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings are
enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server that is
serving as a domain controller, file server, print server, and application server performance
may be substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all
unsigned SMB communications, older applications and operating systems will not be able
to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be
vulnerable to session hijacking attacks. When SMB signing policies are enabled on domain
controllers running Windows Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista
SP1 or Windows Server 2008 group policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available from

integrity of a message can be assessed through message signing. Message signing proves
that the message has not been tampered with; it attaches a cryptographic signature that

This policy setting determines if the server side SMB service is required to perform SMB

clients from using the workstation as a network server.

*Rationale*

Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network as
the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can
potentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then modify the traffic and
forward it so that the server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the attacker
could pose as the server or client after legitimate authentication and gain unauthorized
access to data. SMB is the resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows
operating systems. SMB signatures authenticate both users and the servers that host the
data. If either side fails the authentication process, data transmission will not take place."

Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security
Options\Microsoft network server- Digitally sign communications (always)


*Impact*

The Windows 2000 and later implementations of the SMB file and print sharing protocol
support mutual authentication, which protect against session hijacking attacks and support
message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this
authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then verified by both
the client and the server. Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect
performance, because each packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings are
enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server that is
serving as a domain controller, file server, print server, and application server performance
may be substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all
unsigned SMB communications, older applications and operating systems will not be able
to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be
vulnerable to session hijacking attacks. When SMB signing policies are enabled on domain
controllers running Windows Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista
SP1 or Windows Server 2008 group policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available from

It may be appropriate in some organizations to allow users to install printer drivers on

This policy setting determines whether case insensitivity is enforced for all subsystems.
The Microsoft Win32 subsystem is case insensitive. However, the kernel supports case
sensitivity for other subsystems, such as the Portable Operating System Interface for UNIX
(POSIX). Because Windows is case insensitive (but the POSIX subsystem will support case
sensitivity), failure to enforce this policy setting makes it possible for a user of the POSIX
subsystem to create a file with the same name as another file by using mixed case to label
it. Such a situation can block access to these files by another user who uses typical Win32
tools, because only one of the files will be available.

*Rationale*

Because Windows is case-insensitive but the POSIX subsystem will support case sensitivity,
failure to enable this policy setting would make it possible for a user of that subsystem to
create a file with the same name as another file but with a different mix of upper and lower
case letters. Such a situation could potentially confuse users when they try to access such

This policy setting determines if the server side SMB service is able to sign SMB packets if it

request comes from the client, a connection will be allowed without a signature if the
Microsoft network server- Digitally sign communications (always) setting is not enabled.
Note Enable this policy setting on SMB clients on your network to make them fully effective
for packet signing with all clients and servers in your environment.

*Rationale*

Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network as
the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can
potentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then them so that the server
might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the attacker could pose as the server or
client after legitimate authentication and gain unauthorized access to data. SMB is the
resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows operating systems. SMB
signatures authenticate both users and the servers that host the data. If either side fails the
authentication process, data transmission will not take place."

Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security

*Impact*

The Windows 2000 and later implementations of the SMB file and print sharing protocol
support mutual authentication, which protect against session hijacking attacks and support
message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this
authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then verified by both
the client and the server. Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect
performance, because each packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings are
enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server that is
serving as a domain controller, file server, print server, and application server performance
may be substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all
unsigned SMB communications, older applications and operating systems will not be able
to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be
vulnerable to session hijacking attacks. When SMB signing policies are enabled on domain
controllers running Windows Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista
SP1 or Windows Server 2008 group policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available from
Microsoft that resolves this issue; see Microsoft Knowledgebase Article 950876 for more

This policy setting determines whether to audit user access to an Active Directory object
that has its own specified system access control list (SACL). If you define the Audit
directory service access setting, you can specify whether to audit successes, failures, or not
audit the event type at all. Success audits generate an audit entry when a user successfully
accesses an Active Directory object that has a specified SACL. Failure audits generate an
audit entry when a user unsuccessfully attempts to access an Active Directory object that
has a specified SACL. If you enable the Audit directory service access setting in the DCBP
and configure SACLs on directory objects, a large volume of entries can be generated in the
Security logs on domain controllers. You should only enable this setting if you actually
intend to use the information that is created. The following includes important security
events that the Audit directory service access setting records in the Security log- Event ID
Event description ID Description 566 A generic object operation took place.

*Rationale*

If audit settings are not configured, it can be difficult or impossible to determine what
occurred during a security incident. However, if audit settings are configured so that events
are generated for all activities the Security log will be filled with data and hard to use. Also,
you can use a large amount of data storage as well as adversely affect overall computer

*Impact*

When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information unless the retention
method for each is set so that the computer will overwrite the oldest entries with the most
recent ones. To mitigate the risk of loss of recent data, you can configure the retention
method so that older events are overwritten as needed. The consequence of this
configuration is that older events will be removed from the logs. Attackers can take
advantage of such a configuration, because they can generate a large number of extraneous
events to overwrite any evidence of their attack. These risks can be somewhat reduced if
you automate the archival and backup of event log data. Ideally, all specifically monitored
events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft Operations Manager (MOM) or some
other automated monitoring tool. Such a configuration is particularly important because an
attacker who successfully compromises a server could clear the Security log. If all events
are sent to a monitoring server, then you will be able to gather forensic information about
the attacker's activities.

When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information unless the retention
method for each is set so that the computer will overwrite the oldest entries with the most
recent ones. To mitigate the risk of loss of recent data, you can configure the retention
method so that older events are overwritten as needed. The consequence of this
configuration is that older events will be removed from the logs. Attackers can take
advantage of such a configuration, because they can generate a large number of extraneous
events to overwrite any evidence of their attack. These risks can be somewhat reduced if
you automate the archival and backup of event log data. Ideally, all specifically monitored
events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft Operations Manager (MOM) or some
other automated monitoring tool. Such a configuration is particularly important because an
attacker who successfully compromises a server could clear the Security log. If all events
are sent to a monitoring server, then you will be able to gather forensic information about
the attacker's activities.

This policy setting checks all new passwords to ensure that they meet basic requirements
for strong passwords. When this policy is enabled, passwords must meet the following
minimum requirements- . Not contain the user's account name or parts of the user's full
name that exceed two consecutive characters . Be at least six characters in length . Contain
characters from three of the following four categories- . English uppercase characters (A
through Z) . English lowercase characters (a through z) . Base 10 digits (0 through 9) . Non-
alphabetic characters (for example, !, $, #, %) . A catch-all category of any Unicode
character that does not fall under the previous four categories. This fifth category can be
regionally specific. Each additional character in a password increases its complexity
exponentially. For instance, a seven-character, all lower-case alphabetic password would
have 267 (approximately 8 x 109 or 8 billion) possible combinations. At 1,000,000
attempts per second (a capability of many password-cracking utilities), it would only take
133 minutes to crack. A seven-character alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 527
combinations. A seven-character case-sensitive alphanumeric password without
punctuation has 627 combinations. An eight-character password has 268 (or 2 x 1011)
possible combinations. Although this might seem to be a large number, at 1,000,000
attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try all possible passwords. Remember,
these times will significantly increase for passwords that use ALT characters and other
special keyboard characters such as ! or @. Proper use of the password settings can help
make it difficult to mount a brute force attack.

several publicly available tools."

*Impact*

If the default password complexity configuration is retained, additional help desk calls for
locked-out accounts could occur because users might not be accustomed to passwords that
contain non-alphabetic characters. However, all users should be able to comply with the
complexity requirement with minimal difficulty. If your organization has more stringent
security requirements, you can create a custom version of the Passfilt.dll file that allows the
use of arbitrarily complex password strength rules. For example, a custom password filter
might require the use of non-upper row characters. (Upper row characters are those that
require you to hold down the SHIFT key and press any of the digits between 1 and 0.) A
custom password filter might also perform a dictionary check to verify that the proposed
password does not contain common dictionary words or fragments. Additionally, the use of ALT
key character combinations can greatly enhance the complexity of a password. However,
such stringent password requirements can result in unhappy users and an extremely busy
help desk. Alternatively, your organization could consider a requirement for all
administrator passwords to use ALT characters in the 01280159 range. (ALT characters
outside of this range can represent standard alphanumeric characters that would not add
additional complexity to the password.)

This policy setting determines the least number of characters that make up a password for
a user account. There are many different theories about how to determine the best
password length for an organization, but perhaps pass phrase is a better term than
password. In Microsoft Windows 2000 or later, pass phrases can be quite long and can
include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as I want to drink a $5 milkshake is a valid pass
phrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string of random
numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated about the
proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially with regard to password length.
In enterprise environments, ensure that the value for the Minimum password length
setting is configured to 8 characters. This policy setting is long enough to provide adequate
security. In high security environments, configure the value to 12 characters.

*Rationale*

Types of password attacks include dictionary attacks (which attempt to use common words
and phrases) and brute force attacks (which try every possible combination of characters).
Additionally, attackers sometimes try to obtain the account database so they can use tools to
discover the accounts and passwords."
      solution        : "To implement the recommended configuration state, set the following Group Policy setting

Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies\Password

*Impact*

Requirements for extremely long passwords can actually decrease the security of an
organization, because users might leave the information in an insecure location or lose it. If
very long passwords are required, mistyped passwords could cause account lockouts and
increase the volume of help desk calls. If your organization has issues with forgotten
passwords due to password length requirements, consider teaching your users about pass
phrases, which are often easier to remember and, due to the larger number of character
combinations, much harder to discover.
Note- Older versions of Windows such as Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 do not
support passwords that are longer than 14 characters. Computers that run these older
operating systems are unable to authenticate with computers or domains that use accounts
that require long passwords.

This policy setting determines the number of renewed, unique passwords that have to be
associated with a user account before you can reuse an old password. The value for this
policy setting must be between 0 and 24 passwords. The default value for Windows Vista is
0 passwords, but the default setting in a domain is 24 passwords. To maintain the
effectiveness of this policy setting, use the Minimum password age setting to prevent users
from repeatedly changing their password.

*Rationale*

The longer a user uses the same password, the greater the chance that an attacker can
determine the password through brute force attacks. Additionally, any accounts that may have
been compromised will remain exploitable for as long as the password is left unchanged. If
password changes are required but password reuse is not prevented, or if users continually
reuse a small number of passwords, the effectiveness of a good password policy is greatly
reduced. If you specify a low number for this policy setting, users will be able to use the
same small number of passwords repeatedly. If you do not also configure the Minimum
password age setting, users might repeatedly change their passwords until they can reuse
their original password."

Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies\Password

*Impact*

The major impact of this configuration is that users must create a new password every time
they are required to change their old one. If users are required to change their passwords
to new unique values, there is an increased risk of users who write their passwords
somewhere so that they do not forget them. Another risk is that users may create
passwords that change incrementally (for example, password01, password02, and so on)
to facilitate memorization but make them easier to guess. Additionally, an excessively low value for

This policy setting defines how long a user can use their password before it expires.
Values for this policy setting range from 0 to 999 days. If you set the value to 0, the
password will never expire. The default value for this policy setting is 42 days.
Because attackers can crack passwords, the more frequently you change the password the
less opportunity an attacker has to use a cracked password. However, the lower this value
is set, the higher the potential for an increase in calls to help desk support due to users
having to change their password or forgetting which password is current.


*Rationale*

The longer a password exists the higher the likelihood that it will be compromised by a
brute force attack, by an attacker gaining general knowledge about the user, or by the user
sharing the password. Configuring the Maximum password age setting to 0 so that users
are never required to change their passwords is a major security risk because that allows a
compromised password to be used by the malicious user for as long as the valid user is
authorized access."

Users may have favorite passwords that they like to use because they are easy to

Unfortunately, passwords are compromised and if an attacker is targeting a specific
individual user account, with foreknowledge of data about that user, reuse of old
passwords can cause a security breach. To address password reuse a combination of
security settings is required. Using this policy setting with the Enforce password history
setting prevents the easy reuse of old passwords. For example, if you configure the Enforce
password history setting to ensure that users cannot reuse any of their last 12 passwords,
they could change their password 13 times in a few minutes and reuse the password they
started with, unless you also configure the Minimum password age setting to a number that
is greater than 0. You must configure this policy setting to a number that is greater than 0

      info           : "Set 'Account lockout threshold' to '50' or less (Scored)


This policy setting determines the number of failed logon attempts before a lock occurs.
Authorized users can lock themselves out of an account by mistyping their password or by
remembering it incorrectly, or by changing their password on one computer while logged
on to another computer. The computer with the incorrect password will continuously try to
authenticate the user, and because the password it uses to authenticate is incorrect, a lock
occurs. To avoid accidental lockout of authorized users, set the account lockout threshold
to a high number. The default value for this policy setting is 0 invalid logon attempts, which
disables the account lockout feature.
Because it is possible for an attacker to use this lockout state as a denial of service (DoS) by
triggering a lockout on a large number of accounts, your organization should determine
whether to use this policy setting based on identified threats and the risks you want to
mitigate. There are two options to consider for this policy setting. Configure the value for Account lockout threshold to 0 to ensure that accounts will not be
locked out. This setting value will prevent a DoS attack that attempts to lock out accounts in
your organization. It will also reduce help desk calls, because users will not be able to lock
themselves out of their accounts accidentally. However, this setting value will not prevent a
brute force attack. The following defenses should also be considered- A password policy that forces all users to have complex passwords made up of 8 or more
characters. A robust auditing mechanism, which will alert administrators when a series of account
lockouts occurs in the environment. For example, the auditing solution should monitor for
security event 539, which is a logon failure. This event identifies that there was a lock on
the account at the time of the logon attempt.
The second option is-Configure the value for Account lockout threshold to a value that provides users with the
ability to mistype their password several times, but locks out the account if a brute force
password attack occurs. This configuration will prevent accidental account lockouts and
reduce help desk calls, but will not prevent a DoS attack.


*Rationale*

Password attacks can use automated methods to try millions of password combinations for
any user account. The effectiveness of such attacks can be almost eliminated if you limit the
number of failed logons that can be performed.
However, a denial of service (DoS) attack could be performed on a domain that has an
account lockout threshold configured. An attacker could programmatically attempt a series
of password attacks against all users in the organization. If the number of attempts is
greater than the account lockout threshold, the attacker might be able to lock out every
account."

*Impact*

If this policy setting is enabled, a locked-out account will not be usable until it is reset by an
administrator or until the account lockout duration expires. This setting will likely generate
a number of additional help desk calls. In fact, locked accounts cause the greatest number
of calls to the help desk in many organizations. If you enforce this setting an attacker could cause a denial of service condition by
deliberately generating failed logons for multiple user, therefore you should also configure
the Account Lockout Duration to a relatively low value such as 15 minutes.If you configure the Account Lockout Threshold to 0, there is a possibility that an attacker's
attempt to discover passwords with a brute force password attack might go undetected if a
robust audit mechanism is not in place.

If you leave this policy setting at its default value or configure the value to an interval that

maliciously perform a number of failed logon attempts on all users in the organization,
which will lock out their accounts. If no policy were determined to reset the account
lockout, it would be a manual task for administrators. Conversely, if a reasonable time
value is configured for this policy setting, users would be locked out for a set period until
all of the accounts are unlocked automatically.

*Rationale*

Users can accidentally lock themselves out of their accounts if they mistype their password
multiple times. To reduce the chance of such accidental lockouts, the Reset account lockout

helpers to remotely control the computer . Allow helpers to only view the computer Also,
the following options are available to configure the amount of time that a user help request
remains valid- . Maximum ticket time (value)- . Maximum ticket time (units)- hours,
minutes or days When a ticket (help request) expires, the user must send another request
before an expert can connect to the computer. If you disable the Solicited Remote
Assistance setting, users cannot send help requests and the expert cannot connect to their
computers. If the Solicited Remote Assistance setting is not configured, users can configure
solicited remote assistance through the Control Panel. The following settings are enabled
by default in the Control Panel- Solicited Remote Assistance, Buddy support, and Remote
control. The value for the Maximum ticket time is set to 30 days. If this policy setting is

There is slight risk that a rogue administrator will gain access to another user's desktop
session, however, they cannot connect to a user's computer unannounced or control it
without permission from the user. When an expert tries to connect, the user can still
choose to deny the connection or give the expert view-only privileges. The user must

invitations. Depending on your e-mail program, you can use either the Mailto standard (the
invitation recipient connects through an Internet link) or the SMAPI (Simple MAPI)
standard (the invitation is attached to your e-mail message). This setting is not available in
Windows Vista since SMAPI is the only method supported. If you enable this policy you

This policy setting causes the run once list, which is the list of programs that Windows
Vista runs automatically when it starts, to be ignored. This policy setting differs from the
Do not process the legacy run list setting in that programs on this list will run once the next
time the client computer restarts and an administrator logs on. Setup and installation
programs are sometimes added to this list to complete installations after a client computer
restarts. If you enable this policy setting, attackers generally cannot use the run once list to
launch rogue applications, which was a common method of attack in the past. A malicious
user can exploit the run once list to install a program that may compromise the security of

This policy setting specifies whether Terminal Services always prompts the client
computer for a password upon connection. You can use this policy setting to enforce a
password prompt for users who log on to Terminal Services, even if they already provided
the password in the Remote Desktop Connection client. By default, Terminal Services
allows users to automatically log on if they enter a password in the Remote Desktop
Connection client. The Always prompt client for password upon connection setting is

you do not configure this policy setting, the local computer administrator can use the
Terminal Services Configuration tool to either allow or prevent passwords from being
automatically sent.

*Rationale*

Users have the option to store both their username and password when they create a new
Remote Desktop connection shortcut. If the server that runs Terminal Services allows users
who have used this feature to log on to the server but not enter their password, then it is
possible that an attacker who has gained physical access to the user's computer could

This policy setting controls whether errors are reported. If you configure the Report Errors

default values for any error reporting policies that are not configured.


*Rationale*

In its default configuration, the Windows Corporate Error Reporting features of Windows
XP and Office will send data to Microsoft that some organizations may prefer to keep
confidential. The Microsoft privacy statement for Windows Corporate Error Reporting
ensures that Microsoft will not misuse data that is collected through Windows Corporate
Error Reporting. However, some organizations may want to configure this feature so that
no information is transmitted outside of the organization without first being reviewed by a
trusted member of the IT team. Conversely, if error reporting is disabled completely, it is
more difficult for Microsoft to identify and diagnose new bugs. Organizations that develop
their own internal business applications can also take advantage of Windows Corporate
Error Reporting to track down problems within their code. A reasonable configuration that
ensures privacy and uses Windows Corporate Error Reporting effectively is to set up your
own internal Corporate Error Reporting (CER) servers. Configure your client computers to
point to these servers when they have error reports to submit. An administrator can then
review the reports on the CER server and generate an aggregate report for Microsoft that
contains no confidential information."

This policy setting removes the built-in Windows Vista features that allow users to burn
CDs through Windows Explorer. Windows Vista allows you to create and modify rewritable
CDs if you have a read/write CD drive connected to your computer. This feature can be
used to copy large amounts of data from a hard drive to a CD, which may then be removed
from the computer. Note that this policy setting does not prevent CDs from being modified or
created by third-party applications that use a CD writer. Microsoft recommends the use of
AppLocker or software restriction policies to block the creation or modification of CDs by
third-party applications. Another way to prevent users from burning CDs is to remove the
CD writers from the client computers in your environment or replace them with read-only
CD drives.

*Rationale*

The built-in CD burning feature can be used to surreptitiously copy information that
resides on the computer or on the network."

This policy setting allows you to manage whether users can manually remove the zone

button in the file's Property sheet or select a check box in the Security Warning dialog. If
the zone information is removed, users can open potentially dangerous file attachments
that Windows has prevented users from opening. When the Hide mechanisms to remove
zone information setting is enabled, Windows hides the check box and Unblock button.
When this policy setting is disabled, Windows displays the check box and the Unblock

This policy setting allows you to manage whether Windows marks file attachments from
Internet Explorer or Microsoft Outlook Express with information about their zone of

be downloaded to NTFS disk partitions to function correctly. If zone information is not
preserved, Windows cannot make proper risk assessments based on the zone where the
attachment came from. If the 'Do not preserve zone information in file attachments' setting
is enabled, file attachments are not marked with their zone information. If this policy
