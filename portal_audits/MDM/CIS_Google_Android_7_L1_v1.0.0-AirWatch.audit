Automatically and immediately locking the device as soon as it goes to sleep ensure that there is no lag between the device entering the sleep state and the device getting locked.

The phone eventually enters the sleep state and automatically and immediately locking it ensures that no manual locking of the device is needed.

Rationale:

Rooting your Android device breaks the user level restrictions put by the Android operating system. This significantly opens up the device to allow literally any privileged action. Rooting enables any form of alteration to the device. This puts the device at a much greater risk because any vulnerability can be exploited without any restrictions. This also voids the warranty and future security updates are problematic to install. Hence, for all user purposes, do not root your device.

  description : "1.29 Ensure Wi-Fi hotspot security is set to WPA2-PSK"
  info        : "Secure your Wi-Fi hotspot with WPA2-PSK.

Rationale:

You could set up a Wi-Fi hotspot on your device. Securing it with WPA2-PSK ensures that the connection to this Wi-Fi hotspot could be established only with a password and the data is encrypted in transit. Using WPA2-PSK, the wireless access point uses the common passphrase to generate unique encryption keys for each wireless client. If you set security to None, the Wi-Fi hotspot does not require any authentication and all data could be possibly captured.
