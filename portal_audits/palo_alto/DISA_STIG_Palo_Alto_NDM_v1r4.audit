  info        : "Without the capability to restrict which roles and individuals can select which events are audited, unauthorized personnel may be able to prevent the auditing of critical events. Misconfigured audits may degrade the system's performance by overwhelming the audit log. Misconfigured audits may also make it more difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.

With the Palo Alto Networks security platform, Administrators can be assigned one of these built-in dynamic roles: Superuser, Superuser (read-only), Device administrator, Device administrator (read-only), Virtual system administrator, and Virtual system administrator (read-only) or they can be assigned one of the three pre-configured Role Based profiles (auditadmin, cryptoadmin, or securityadmin) or they can be assigned a custom profile.  The Audit Administrator (auditadmin) role is responsible for the regular review of the device's audit data.  The Superuser and Device administrator have full (both read and write) access to the device while the Virtual system administrator has full (both read and write) access to a specific virtual system instance.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

  info             : "Protection of log data includes assuring log data is not accidentally lost or deleted. Regularly forwarding logs to a syslog server helps to assure, in the event of a catastrophic system failure, the audit records will be retained.

This requirement is met by configuring the Palo Alto Networks security platform to forward logs to a syslog server or a Panorama network security management server.  Note that the syslog server(s) must be backed up regularly, but that is not the focus of this requirement."
  solution         : "Configuring the Palo Alto Networks security platform to forward logs to a syslog server depends on which log it is.
Create a Syslog Server profile:
Go to Device >> Server Profiles >> Syslog
Select 'Add'.
In the 'Syslog Server Profile', enter the name of the profile; select 'Add'.

In the 'Servers' tab, enter the required information:
Name: Name of the syslog server
Server: Server IP address where the logs will be forwarded to
Port: Default port 514
Facility: Select from the drop down list
Select 'OK'.

Enable log forwarding for the Traffic Log and Threat Log. Configure the log-forwarding profile to select the logs to be forwarded to syslog server.
Go to Objects >> Log forwarding
Select 'Add'.
The 'Log Forwarding Profile' window appears.  Note that it has five columns.
Traffic Settings - in the 'Syslog' column, select the 'Syslog Server Profile'.
Threat Settings - select the severity levels that will be sent to the syslog server; for each selected level, select the Syslog Server Profile.
Enable log forwarding for the Configuration Log.
Go to Device >> Log Settings >> Config
Select the 'Edit' icon (the gear symbol in the upper-right corner of the pane)
In the 'Log Settings - Config' window, in the 'Syslog' drop-down box, select the configured server profile
Select 'OK'.

Enable log forwarding of System Log:
Go to Device >> Log Settings >> System
The list of severity levels is displayed. Select a Server Profile for each severity level to forward.  The 'informational' severity level is optional; all others are mandatory.
Select each severity level in turn; with each selection, the 'Log Systems - Setting' window will appear.
In the 'Log Systems - Setting' window, in the 'Syslog' drop-down box, select the configured server profile.
Select 'OK'.

For Traffic Logs and Threat Logs, use the log forwarding profile in the security rules:
Go to Policies >> Security
Select the rule for which the log forwarding needs to be applied. Apply the security profiles to the rule.
Go to 'Actions' tab; in the 'Log forwarding' field, select the log forwarding profile.
Commit changes by selecting 'Commit' in the upper-right corner of the screen.
Select 'OK' when the confirmation dialog appears."

  info             : "In order to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information, or unauthorized tunneling (i.e., embedding of data types within data types), organizations must disable unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols on information systems.

Network devices are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services provided by default may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations. Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single component (e.g., email and web services); however, doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component.

To support the requirements and principles of least functionality, the network device must support the organizational requirements providing only essential capabilities and limiting the use of ports, protocols, and/or services to only those required, authorized, and approved to conduct official business or to address authorized quality of life issues.

The Palo Alto Networks security platform uses a hardened operating system in which unnecessary services are not present.  The device has a DNS, NTP, update, and e-mail client installed.  Note that these are client applications and not servers; additionally, each has a valid purpose.  However, local policy may dictate that the update service, e-mail client, and statistics (reporting) service capabilities not be used. DNS can be either 'Server' or 'Proxy'; both are allowed unless local policy declares otherwise. NTP and SNMP are necessary functions.

  description : "PANW-NM-000131 - The Palo Alto Networks security platform must use automated mechanisms to alert security personnel to threats identified by authoritative sources (e.g., CTOs) and IAW CJCSM 6510.01B."
  info        : "CJCSM 6510.01B, 'Cyber Incident Handling Program', in subsection e.(6)(c) sets forth three requirements for Cyber events detected by an automated system;
If the cyber event is detected by an automated system, an alert will be sent to the POC designated for receiving such automated alerts.
CC/S/A/FAs that maintain automated detection systems and sensors must ensure that a POC for receiving the alerts has been defined and that the IS configured to send alerts to that POC.
The POC must then ensure that the cyber event is reviewed as part of the preliminary analysis phase and reported to the appropriate individuals if it meets the criteria for a reportable cyber event or incident.

By immediately displaying an alarm message, potential security violations can be identified more quickly even when administrators are not logged on to the network device. An example of a mechanism to facilitate this would be through the utilization of SNMP traps.

The Palo Alto Networks security platform can be configured to send messages to an SNMP server and to an e-mail server as well as a Syslog server.  SNMP traps can be generated for each of the five logging event types on the firewall: traffic, threat, system, hip, config.  For this requirement, only the threat logs must be sent.  Note that only traffic that matches an action in a rule will be logged and forwarded. In the case of traps, the messages are initiated by the firewall and sent unsolicited to the management stations.

The use of e-mail as a notification method may result in a very larger number of messages being sent and possibly overwhelming the e-mail server as well as the POC.  The use of SNMP is preferred over e-mail in general, but organizations may want to use e-mail in addition to SNMP for high-priority messages.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

When represented as a hexadecimal string, this is between 10 and 128 characters (2 characters for each byte) with two additional characters for 0x that must be used as a prefix in the input string.

If using Active Directory, enter the NetBIOS domain name; not a FQDN (for example, enter acme, not acme.com). Note that if collecting data from multiple domains, it is necessary to create separate server profiles. If using a global catalog server, leave this field blank.
Select the Type of LDAP server connecting to. The correct LDAP attributes in the group mapping settings will automatically be populated based on the selection.
In the Base field, select the DN that corresponds to the point in the LDAP tree where the firewall is to begin its search for user and group information.
