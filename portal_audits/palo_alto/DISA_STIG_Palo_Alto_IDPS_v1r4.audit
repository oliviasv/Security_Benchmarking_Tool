In short, log records are audited to establish an accurate history. Without logging, it would be impossible to establish an audit trail.

The logs should identify what servers, destination addresses, applications, or databases were potentially attacked by logging communications traffic between the target and the attacker. All commands that were entered by the attacker (such as account creations, changes in permissions, files accessed, etc.) during the session should also be logged when capturing for forensic analysis.

Packet captures of attack traffic can be used by forensic tools for analysis for example, to determine if an alert is real or a false alarm or for forensics for threat intelligence. Configure the packet capture filters so that the CPU is not overloaded.  There are many reasons for a packet capture.

  info             : "Without an alert, security personnel may be unaware of an impending failure of the audit capability, and the ability to perform forensic analysis and detect rate-based and other anomalies will be impeded.

The IDPS generates an immediate (within seconds) alert which notifies designated personnel of the incident. Sending a message to an unattended log or console does not meet this requirement since that will not be seen immediately. These messages should include a severity level indicator or code as an indicator of the criticality of the incident.

When the Palo Alto Networks security platform blocks malicious code, it also generates a record in the threat log.  This message has a medium severity."
  solution         : "The following is an example of how to configure the device to send messages to e-mail; this is one option that meets the requirement.  If sending messages to an SNMP server or Syslog servers is used, follow the vendor guidance on how to configure that function.

To create an email server profile:
Go to Device >> Server Profiles >> Email
Select 'Add'.
In the 'Email Server Profile' field, enter the name of the profile.
Select 'Add'.
In the 'Servers' tab, enter the required information.
In the 'Name' field, enter the name of the Email server.
In the 'Email Display' Name field, enter the name shown in the 'From' field of the email.
In the 'From' field, enter the 'From email address'.
In the 'To' field, enter the email address of the recipient.
In the 'Additional Recipient' field, enter the email address of another recipient. You can only add one additional recipient. To add multiple recipients, add the email address of a distribution list.
In the 'Gateway' field, enter the IP address or host name of the Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) server used to send the email.
Select 'OK'.

After you create the Server Profiles that define where to send your logs, you must enable log forwarding.
Threat Logs-Enable forwarding of Threat logs by creating a Log Forwarding Profile (Objects >> Log Forwarding) that specifies which severity levels you want to forward and then adding it to the security policies for which you want to trigger the log forwarding. A Threat log entry will only be created (and therefore forwarded) if the associated traffic matches a Security Profile (Antivirus, Anti-spyware, Vulnerability, URL Filtering, File Blocking, Data Filtering, or DoS Protection).

Configure the log-forwarding profile to select the logs to be forwarded to Email server.
Go to Objects >> Log forwarding
The 'Log Forwarding Profile' window appears.  Note that it has five columns.
In the 'Name' Field, enter the name of the Log Forwarding Profile.
In the 'Threat Settings Section' in the 'Email' column, select the Email server profile for forwarding threat logs to the configured server(s).
Select 'OK'.

When the 'Log Forwarding Profile' window disappears, the screen will show the configured log-forwarding profile.
For Threat Logs, use the log forwarding profile in the security rules.
Go to Policies >> Security Rule
Select the rule for which the log forwarding needs to be applied, which in this case is the Security Policy that is used to detect malicious code (the 'Profile column' does display the Antivirus Profile symbol). Apply the log forwarding profile to the rule.
In the 'Actions' tab in the 'Log Setting' section; in the 'Log Forwarding' field, select the log forwarding profile from drop-down list.  Note that the 'Log Forwarding' field can only have one profile.
Commit changes by selecting 'Commit' in the upper-right corner of the screen.  Select 'OK' when the confirmation dialog appears."

  info             : "Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) messages are used to provide feedback about problems in the network. These messages are sent back to the sender to support diagnostics. However, some messages can also provide host information and network topology that may be exploited by an attacker.

Three ICMP messages are commonly used by attackers for network mapping: Destination Unreachable, Redirect, and Address Mask Reply. These responses must be blocked on external interfaces; however, blocking the Destination Unreachable response will prevent Path Maximum Transmission Unit Discovery (PMTUD), which relies on the response 'ICMP Destination Unreachable--Fragmentation Needed but DF Bit Set'. PMTUD is a useful function and should only be 'broken' after careful consideration.

An acceptable alternative to blocking all Destination Unreachable responses is to filter Destination Unreachable messages generated by the IDPS to allow ICMP Destination Unreachable-Fragmentation Needed but DF Bit Set (Type 3, Code 4) and apply this filter to the external interfaces."

  solution         : "To create a syslog server profile:
Go to Device >> Server Profiles >> Syslog
Select 'Add'.
In the Syslog Server Profile, enter the name of the profile.
Select 'Add'.
In the 'Servers' tab, enter the required information.
Name: Name of the syslog server
Server: Server IP address where the logs will be forwarded to
Port: Default port 514
Facility: Select from the drop down list
Select 'OK'.

After you create the Server Profiles that define where to send your logs, you must enable log forwarding.
The way to enable forwarding depends on the log type:
Traffic Logs- Enable forwarding of Traffic logs by creating a Log Forwarding Profile (Objects >> Log Forwarding) and adding it to the security policies you want to trigger the log forwarding. Only traffic that matches a specific rule within the security policy will be logged and forwarded.
Configure the log-forwarding profile to select the logs to be forwarded to syslog server.
Go to Objects >> Log forwarding
The 'Log Forwarding Profile' window appears.  Note that it has five columns.  In the 'Syslog' column, select the syslog server profile for forwarding threat logs to the configured server(s).
Select 'OK'.

When the 'Log Forwarding Profile' window disappears, the screen will show the configured log-forwarding profile.
Threat Logs-You enable forwarding of Threat logs by creating a Log Forwarding Profile (Objects >> Log Forwarding) that specifies which severity levels you want to forward and then adding it to the security policies for which you want to trigger the log forwarding. A Threat log entry will only be created (and therefore forwarded) if the associated traffic matches a Security Profile (Antivirus, Anti-spyware, Vulnerability, URL Filtering, File Blocking, Data Filtering, or DoS Protection).
Configure the log-forwarding profile to select the logs to be forwarded to syslog server.
Go to Objects >> Log forwarding.
The 'Log Forwarding Profile' window appears.  Note that it has five columns.  In the 'Syslog' column, select the syslog server profile for forwarding threat logs to the configured server(s).
Select 'OK'.

When the 'Log Forwarding Profile' window disappears, the screen will show the configured log-forwarding profile.
System Logs-You enable forwarding of System logs by specifying a Server Profile in the log settings configuration.
Go to Device >> Log Settings >> System Logs
The list of severity levels is displayed.

Select a Server Profile for each severity level to forward.
Select each severity level in turn; with each selection, the 'Log Systems - Setting' window will appear.
In the 'Log Systems - Setting' window, in the 'Syslog' drop-down box, select the configured Server Profile.
Select 'OK'.

Config Logs-You enable forwarding of Config logs by specifying a Server Profile in the log settings configuration.
Go to Device >> Log Settings >> Config Logs
Select the 'Edit' icon (the gear symbol in the upper-right corner of the pane).
In the 'Log Settings Config' window, in the 'Syslog' drop-down box, select the configured Server Profile.
Select 'OK'.

For Traffic Logs and Threat Logs, use the log forwarding profile in the security rules.
Go to Policies >> Security Rule
Select the rule for which the log forwarding needs to be applied. Apply the security profiles to the rule.
Go to Actions >> Log forwarding
Select the log forwarding profile from drop-down list.

Off-loading is a common process in information systems with limited audit storage capacity. The audit storage on the device is used only in a transitory fashion until the system can communicate with the centralized log server designated for storing the audit records, at which point the information is transferred. However, DoD requires that the log be transferred in real-time which indicates that the time from event detection to off-loading is seconds or less.

This does not apply to audit logs generated on behalf of the device itself (management)."
  solution         : "To create a syslog server profile:
Go to Device >> Server Profiles >> Syslog
Select 'Add'.
In the Syslog Server Profile, enter the name of the profile.
Select 'Add'.
In the 'Servers' tab, enter the required information.
Name: Name of the syslog server
Server: Server IP address where the logs will be forwarded to
Port: Default port 514
Facility: Select from the drop-down list.
Select 'OK.

After you create the Server Profiles that define where to send your logs, you must enable log forwarding.
The way you enable forwarding depends on the log type:
Traffic Logs-You enable forwarding of Traffic logs by creating a Log Forwarding Profile (Objects >> Log Forwarding) and adding it to the security policies you want to trigger the log forwarding. Only traffic that matches a specific rule within the security policy will be logged and forwarded.
Configure the log-forwarding profile to select the logs to be forwarded to syslog server.
Go to Objects >> Log forwarding.
The 'Log Forwarding Profile' window appears.  Note that it has five columns.  In the 'Syslog' column, select the syslog server profile for forwarding threat logs to the configured server(s).
Select 'OK.

When the 'Log Forwarding Profile' window disappears, the screen will show the configured log-forwarding profile.
Threat Logs-You enable forwarding of Threat logs by creating a Log Forwarding Profile (Objects >> Log Forwarding) that specifies which severity levels you want to forward and then adding it to the security policies for which you want to trigger the log forwarding. A Threat log entry will only be created (and therefore forwarded) if the associated traffic matches a Security Profile (Antivirus, Anti-spyware, Vulnerability, URL Filtering, File Blocking, Data Filtering, or DoS Protection).
Configure the log-forwarding profile to select the logs to be forwarded to syslog server.
Go to Objects >> Log forwarding
The 'Log Forwarding Profile' window appears.  Note that it has five columns.  In the 'Syslog' column, select the syslog server profile for forwarding threat logs to the configured server(s).
Select 'OK'.

When the 'Log Forwarding Profile' window disappears, the screen will show the configured log-forwarding profile.
System Logs-You enable forwarding of System logs by specifying a Server Profile in the log settings configuration.
Go to Device >> Log Settings >> System Logs
The list of severity levels is displayed.
You must select a Server Profile for each severity level you want to forward.
Select each severity level in turn; with each selection, the 'Log Systems - Setting' window will appear.
In the 'Log Systems - Setting' window, in the 'Syslog' drop-down box, select the configured Server Profile.
Select 'OK.

Config Logs-You enable forwarding of Config logs by specifying a Server Profile in the log settings configuration.
Go to Device >> Log Settings >> Config Logs
Select the 'Edit' icon (the gear symbol in the upper-right corner of the pane).
In the 'Log Settings Config' window, in the 'Syslog' drop-down box, select the configured Server Profile.
Select 'OK.

For Traffic Logs and Threat Logs, use the log forwarding profile in the security rules.
Go to Policies >> Security Rule
Select the rule for which the log forwarding needs to be applied. Apply the security profiles to the rule.
Go to Actions >> Log forwarding
Select the log forwarding profile from drop-down list.
