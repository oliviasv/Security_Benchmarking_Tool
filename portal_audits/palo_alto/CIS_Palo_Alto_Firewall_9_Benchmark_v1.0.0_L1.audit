Rationale:

Sending all system logs to a remote host is recommended to provide protected, long term storage and archiving. This also places a copy of the logs in a second location, in case the primary (on the firewall) logs are compromised. Storing logs on a remote host also allows for more flexible log searches and log processing, as well as many methods of triggering events or scripts based on specific log events or combinations of events. Finally, remote logging provides many organizations with the opportunity to combine logs from disparate infrastructure in a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system.

Logging to an external system is also usually required by most regulatory frameworks."

Impact:

Failure to properly store and archive logs for critical infrastructure leaves an organization without the tools required to establish trends in events or activity, or to retrospectively analyze security or operational events beyond the log timespan stored on the firewall. Not having remote logs also puts many organizations outside of compliance with many regulatory frameworks. Finally, not logging to a remote host leaves organizations without recourse in the event of a compromise of logs on the primary device. It is imperative that organizations log critical infrastructure appropriately, store and archive these logs in a central location, and have a robust set of tools to analyze logs both in real time and after the fact.

Default Value:

By default no external logging is defined

      info             : "Syslog logging is a standard logging protocol that is widely supported. It is recommended for a level 1 deployment only, as syslog does not support encryption.

Rationale:

Sending all system logs to a remote host is recommended to provide protected, long term storage and archiving. This also places a copy of the logs in a second location, in case the primary (on the firewall) logs are compromised. Storing logs on a remote host also allows for more flexible log searches and log processing, as well as many methods of triggering events or scripts based on specific log events or combinations of events. Finally, remote logging provides many organizations with the opportunity to combine logs from disparate infrastructure in a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system.

Logging to an external system is also usually required by most regulatory frameworks."

Under Configuration, add an entry. Define a Name and a Filter setting. Under Forward Methods, add a Syslog Profile in the Syslog section. Ensure that at least one of the Log Settings Configuration entries has it's Filter setting at All Logs
Under User-ID, add an entry. Define a Name and a Filter setting. Under Forward Methods, add a Syslog Profile in the Syslog section. Ensure that at least one of the Log Settings Configuration entries has it's Filter setting at All Logs
Under HIP Match (Host Information Profile), add an entry. Define a Name and a Filter setting. Under Forward Methods, add a Syslog Profile in the Syslog section. Ensure that at least one of the Log Settings Configuration entries has it's Filter setting at All Logs
Under IP-Tag, add an entry. Define a Name and a Filter setting. Under Forward Methods, add a Syslog Profile in the Syslog section. Ensure that at least one of the Log Settings Configuration entries has it's Filter setting at All Logs

Impact:

Failure to properly store and archive logs for critical infrastructure leaves an organization without the tools required to establish trends in events or activity, or to retrospectively analyze security or operational events beyond the log timespan stored on the firewall. Not having remote logs also puts many organizations outside of compliance with many regulatory frameworks. Finally, not logging to a remote host leaves organizations without recourse in the event of a compromise of logs on the primary device. It is imperative that organizations log critical infrastructure appropriately, store and archive these logs in a central location, and have a robust set of tools to analyze logs both in real time and after the fact.

Default Value:

By default no external logging is defined

Rationale:

Password complexity recommendations are derived from the USGCB (United States Government Configuration Baseline), Common Weakness Enumeration, and benchmarks published by the CIS (Center for Internet Security). Password complexity adds entropy to a password, in comparison to a simple password of the same length. A complex password is more difficult to attack, either directly against administrative interfaces or cryptographically, against captured password hashes. However, making a password of greater length will generally have a greater impact in this regard, in comparison to making a shorter password more complex."

Set Enabled to be checked
Set that the various password settings to values that are appropriate to your organization. It is suggested that there at least be some special characters enforced, and that a minimum length be set. Ensure that non-zero values are set for Minimum Uppercase, Lowercase and Special Characters. 'Block Username Inclusion' should be enabled.
Operationally, dictionary words should be avoided for all passwords - passphrases are a much better alternative.

Impact:

Simple passwords make an attacker's job very easy. There is a reasonably short list of commonly used admin passwords for network infrastructure, not enforcing password lengths and complexity can lend itself to making an attacker's brute force attack successful.

Default Value:

Not enabled.

Rationale:

A longer password is much more difficult to attack, either directly against administrative interfaces or cryptographically, against captured password hashes. Making a password of greater length will generally have a greater impact in this regard, in comparison to making a shorter password more complex. Passphrases are a commonly used recommendation, to make longer passwords more palatable to end users. Administrative staff however generally use 'password safe' applications, so a long and complex password is more easily implemented for most infrastructure administrative interfaces."

Set Minimum Length to greater than or equal to 12

Impact:

Longer passwords are much more difficult to attack. This is true of attacks against the administrative interfaces themselves, or of decryption attacks against captured hashes. A longer password will almost always have a more positive impact than a shorter but more complex password.

Set Required Password Change Period (days) to less than or equal to 90

Impact:

Failure to change administrative passwords can result in a slow 'creep' of people who have access. Especially in a situation with high staff turnover (for instance, in a NOC or SOC situation), administrative passwords need to be changed frequently.

Administrative credentials should not be shared across multiple devices. In a NOC/SOC situation, it's important to not share administrative credentials between operators (names accounts should be used), and in particular administrative credentials should never be shared across different customer infrastructures.

This guidance is currently under some debate in the community. If the password length is sufficient and password complexity is enforced, then in many organizations it is likely that the password change period can be increased to 6, 9 or even 12 months."

Rationale:

The longer a user uses the same password, the greater the chance that an attacker can determine the password through brute force attacks. Also, any accounts that may have been compromised will remain exploitable for as long as the password is left unchanged. If password changes are required but password reuse is not prevented, or if users continually reuse a small number of passwords, the effectiveness of a good password policy is greatly reduced. While current guidance emphasizes password length above frequent password changes, not enforcing password re-use guidance adds the temptation of using a small pool of passwords, which can make an attacker's job easier across an entire infrastructure."

Rationale:

NTP enables the device to maintain an accurate time and date when receiving updates from a reliable NTP server. Accurate timestamps are critical when correlating events with other systems, troubleshooting, or performing investigative work. Logs and certain cryptographic functions, such as those utilizing certificates, rely on accurate time and date parameters. In addition, rules referencing a Schedule object will not function as intended if the device's time and date are incorrect.

For additional security, authenticated NTP can be utilized. If Symmetric Key authentication is selected, only SHA1 should be used, as MD5 is considered severely compromised.

Most organizations will maintain a pair of internal NTP servers for all internal time services. These servers will either be self-contained atomic clocks, or will collect time from a known reliable source (often GPS or a well-known internet server pool will be used)."

Rationale:

If presented with a certificate error, the end user in most cases will not be able to tell if their session is using a self-signed or expired certificate, or if their session is being eavesdropped on or injected into by a 'Man in the Middle' attack.

There is rarely a legitimate need to allow WMI probing (or any user-id identification) on an untrusted interface. The exception to this is identification of remote-access VPN users, who are identified as they connect.

Rationale:

PAN released a customer advisory in October of 2014 warning of WMI probing on untrusted interfaces with User-ID enabled. This can result in theft of the password hash for the account used in WMI probing.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

Set User-ID to be checked only for interfaces that are both internal and trusted; uncheck it for all other interfaces.

Impact:

If WMI probing is enabled without limiting the scope, internet hosts that are sources or destinations of traffic will be probed, and the password hash of the configured Domain Admin account can be captured by an outside attacker on such a host.

Default Value:

By default WMI probing and all User-ID functions are disabled.

Rationale:

The Include/Exclude Networks feature allow users to configure boundaries for the User-ID service. By using the feature to limit User-ID probing to only trusted internal networks, the risks of privileged information disclosure through sent probes can be reduced.

Set all trusted internal networks to have a Discovery value of Include.
Set all untrusted external networks to have a Discovery value of Exclude. Note that any value in the trusted networks list implies that all other networks are untrusted.

Impact:

Not restricting the networks subject to User Identification means that the administrative credentials (userid and password hash) used for this task will transit untrusted networks, or be sent to untrusted hosts. Capturing these credentials exposes them to offline cracking attacks.

By using the feature to limit User-ID probing to only trusted internal networks, the risks of privileged information disclosure through sent probes can be reduced. Note that if an entry appears in the Include/Exclude Networks section, an implicit exclude-all-networks policy will take effect for all other networks."
          solution    : "Navigate to Device > User Identification > User Mapping > Include/Exclude Networks.
Set all trusted internal networks to have a Discovery value of Include.
Set all untrusted external networks to have a Discovery value of Exclude. Note that any value in the trusted networks list implies that all other networks are untrusted.

Impact:

Not restricting the networks subject to User Identification means that the administrative credentials (userid and password hash) used for this task will transit untrusted networks, or be sent to untrusted hosts. Capturing these credentials exposes them to offline cracking attacks.

Default Value:

As a principle of least privilege, user accounts should have only minimum necessary permissions. If an attacker compromises a User-ID service account with domain admin rights, the organization is at far greater risk than if the service account were only granted minimum rights.

Set the service account for the User-ID agent so that it is only a member of the Event Log Readers, Distributed COM Users, and Domain Users (for the integrated, on-device User-ID agent) or the Event Log Readers, Server Operators, and Domain Users groups (for the Windows User-ID agent.)





Impact:

Using accounts with full administrative privileges when those rights are not required is always a bad idea. This is particularly true for service accounts of this type, which in many organizations do not see strong passwords or frequent password changes. In addition, service passwords are stored in the Windows Registry, and are recoverable with the user of appropriate malicious tools. The principal of least privilege means that any compromised accounts of this type have less value to an attacker, and expose fewer assets based on their rights.

      info             : "The CA Certificate used for in-line HTTP Man in the Middle should be trusted by target users. For SSL Forward Proxy configurations, there are classes of users that need to be considered.

1: Users that are members of the organization, users of machines under control of the organization. For these people and machines, ensure that the CA Certificate is in one of the Trusted CA certificate stores. This is easily done in Active Directory, using Group Policies for instance. A MDM (Mobile Device Manager) can be used to accomplish the same task for mobile devices such as telephones or tablets. Other central management or orchestration tools can be used for Linux or 'IoT' (Internet of Things) devices.

2: Users that are not member of the organization - often these are classed as 'Visitors' in the policies of the organization. If a public CA Certificate is a possibility for your organization, then that is one approach. A second approach is to not decrypt affected traffic - this is easily done, but leaves the majority of 'visitor' traffic uninspected and potentially carrying malicious content. The final approach, and the one most commonly seen, is to use the same certificate as is used for the hosting organization. In this last case, visitors will see a certificate warning, but the issuing CA will be the organization that they are visiting.

Rationale:

Using a self-signed certificate, or any certificate that generates a warning in the browser, means that members of the organization have no method of determining if they are being presented with a legitimate certificate, or an attacker's 'man in the middle' certificate. It also very rapidly teaches members of the organization to bypass all security warnings of this type."
      solution         : "Set the CA Certificate(s):
Navigate to Device > Certificate Management > Certificates. Import the appropriate CA Certificates from any internal Certificate Authorities.
Alternatively, generate a self-signed certificate for an internal CA on the firewall, and then import the root certificate for that CA into the trusted CA list of target clients. In an Active Directory environment this can be facilitated using a Group Policy.

Navigate to Device > Certificate Management > Certificate Profile.

Alternatively, configure the WildFire cloud to generate alerts for malicious files. The cloud can generate alerts in addition to or instead of the local WildFire implementation. Note that the destination email address of alerts configured in the WildFire cloud portal is tied to the logged in account, and cannot be modified. Also, new systems added to the WildFire cloud portal will not be automatically set to email alerts.

Rationale:

WildFire analyzes files that have already been downloaded and possibly executed. A WildFire verdict of malicious indicates that a computer could already be infected. In addition, because WildFire only analyzes files it has not already seen that were not flagged by the firewall's antivirus filter, files deemed malicious by WildFire are more likely to evade detection by desktop antivirus products.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

Antivirus signatures produce low false positives. By blocking any detected malware through the specified decoders, the threat of malware propagation through the firewall is greatly reduced. It is recommended to mitigate malware found in pop3 and imap through a dedicated antivirus gateway.

Rationale:

By applying a secure antivirus profile to all applicable traffic, the threat of malware propagation through the firewall is greatly reduced.

Impact:

Not having an AV Profile on a Security Policy allows signature-based malware to transit the security boundary without blocks or alerts. In most cases this leaves only the Endpoint Security application to block or alert malware.

If multiple rules exist within the anti-spyware profile, ensure all spyware categories, threats, and severity levels are set to be blocked. Additional rules may exist for packet capture or exclusion purposes.

Rationale:

Requiring a blocking policy for all spyware threats, categories, and severities reduces the risk of spyware traffic from successfully exiting the organization. Without an anti-spyware profile assigned to any potential hostile zone, the first protection in the path against malware is removed, leaving in most cases only the desktop endpoint protection application to detect and remediate any potential spyware."

Set a rule within the anti-spyware profile that is configured to perform the Block Action on any Severity level, any Category, and any Threat Name.

Two Anti-Spyware Security Profiles are configured by default 'strict' and 'default'.

DNS sinkholing helps to identify infected clients by spoofing DNS responses for malware domain queries.

Rationale:

Standard URL filtering provides protection against inappropriate and malicious URLs and IP addresses. PAN-DB URL Filtering is slightly less granular than the BrightCloud URL filtering. However the PAN-DB Filter offers additional malware protection and PAN threat intelligence by using the Wildfire service as an additional input, which is currently not available in the BrightCloud URL Filtering license. This makes the PAN-DB filter more responsive to specific malware 'campaigns'."
      solution         : "Navigate to Device > Licenses.
Click on PAN-DB URL Filtering.
Set Active to Yes.

Impact:

Not having an effective URL Filtering configuration can leave an organization open to legal action, internal HR issues, non-compliance with regulatory policies or productivity loss.

      info             : "Ideally, deciding which URL categories to block, and which to allow, is a joint effort between IT and another entity of authority within an organization-such as the legal department or administration. For most organizations, blocking or requiring an override on the following categories represents a minimum baseline: adult, hacking, command-and-control, copyright-infringement, extremism, malware, phishing, proxy-avoidance-and-anonymizers, and parked. Some organizations may add 'unknown' and 'dynamic-dns' to this list, at the expense of some support calls on those topics.

Rationale:

Certain URL categories pose a technology-centric threat, such as command-and-control, copyright-infringement, extremism, malware, phishing, proxy-avoidance-and-anonymizers, and parked. Users visiting websites in these categories, many times unintentionally, are at greater risk of compromising the security of their system. Other categories, such as adult, may pose a legal liability and will be blocked for those reasons.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

Set a URL filter so that all URL categories designated by the organization are listed.
Navigate to the Actions tab.

Impact:

Not having an effective URL Filtering configuration can leave an organization open to legal action, internal HR issues, non-compliance with regulatory policies or productivity loss.

Rationale:

Logging HTTP header information provides additional information in the URL logs, which may be useful during forensic investigations. The User-Agent option logs which browser was used during the web session, which could provide insight to the vector used for malware retrieval. The Referrer option logs the source webpage responsible for referring the user to the logged webpage. The X-Forwarded-For option is useful for preserving the user's source IP address, such as if a user traverses a proxy server prior to the firewall. Un-checking the Log container page only box produces substantially more information about web activity, with the expense of producing far more entries in the URL logs. If this option remains checked, a URL filter log entry showing details of a malicious file download may not exist."

a. Log container page only box is un-checked
b. Check the User-Agent box
c. Check the Referrer box

Impact:

Not having an effective URL Filtering configuration can leave an organization open to legal action, internal HR issues, non-compliance with regulatory policies or productivity loss.

      info             : "Enable the SYN Flood Action of SYN Cookies for all untrusted zones. The Alert, Activate, and Maximum settings for SYN Flood Protection depend highly on the environment and device used. Perform traffic analysis on the specific environment and firewall to determine accurate thresholds. Do not rely on default values to be appropriate for an environment.

Setting these values for all interfaces is an approach that should be considered by many organizations, as traffic floods can result from internal testing or malware as well.

As a rough ballpark for most environments, an Activate value of 50% of the firewall's maximum 'New sessions per second'/CPS is a conservative setting. The following is a list of new sessions per second maximum for each platform:

PA-200 = 1,000 CPS

PA-500 = 7,500 CPS

PA-2000 series = 15,000 CPS

PA-3000 series = 50,000 CPS

PA-5000 series = 120,000 CPS

PA-7050 = 720,000 CPS

Rationale:

Protecting resources and the firewall itself against DoS/DDoS attacks requires a layered approach. Firewalls alone cannot mitigate all DoS attacks, however, many attacks can be successfully mitigated. Utilizing SYN Cookies helps to mitigate SYN flood attacks, where the CPU and/or memory buffers of the victim device become overwhelmed by incomplete TCP sessions. SYN Cookies are preferred over Random Early Drop."
      solution         : "From GUI:
Navigate to Network > Network Profiles > Zone Protection > Zone Protection Profile > Flood Protection tab.
Check the SYN box. Set the Action dropdown to SYN Cookies Set Alert to 20000(or appropriate for org). Set Activate to 25000(50% of maximum for firewall model). Set Maximum to 1000000(or appropriate for org)
Navigate to Network > Zones >. Open the zone facing any untrusted network, if one does not exist create it. Set Zone Protection to the Zone Protection Profile created.

Impact:

Not configuring a Network Zone Protection Profile on untrusted interfaces leaves an organization exposed to common attacks and reconnaissance from those untrusted networks. Not configuring a Zone Protection Profile for internal networks leaves an organization vulnerable to malware, software or hardware causes of traffic flooding from internal sources.

Attach appropriate Zone Protection profiles meeting these criteria to all zones. Separate Zone Protection profiles for trusted and untrusted zones is a best practice.

Rationale:

Port scans and host sweeps are common in the reconnaissance phase of an attack. Bots scouring the Internet in search of a vulnerable target may also scan for open ports and available hosts. Reconnaissance Protection will allow for these attacks to be either alerted on or blocked altogether."

Impact:

Not configuring a Network Zone Protection Profile leaves an organization exposed to common attacks and reconnaissance from untrusted networks.

Some sanctioned SAS applications may have connections to the corporate domain, in which case they will need to be exempt from the user credential submission policy through a custom URL category.

Under the User Credential Detection tab set the User Credential Detection value to a setting appropriate to your organization, any value except Disabled. Set the Log Severity to a value appropriate to your organization and your logging or SIEM solution.

Impact:

Not preventing users from submitting their corporate credentials to the Internet can leave them open to phishing attacks or allow for credential reuse on unauthorized sites. Using internal email accounts provides malicious actors with intelligence information, which can be used for phishing, credential stuffing and other attacks. Using internal passwords will often provide authenticated access directly to sensitive information. Not only that, but a pattern of credential re-use can expose personal information from multiple online sources.

      info             : "When permitting traffic from an untrusted zone, such as the Internet or guest network, to a more trusted zone, such as a DMZ segment, create security policies specifying which specific applications are allowed.

**Enhanced Security Recommendation: ** Require specific application policies when allowing any traffic, regardless of the trust level of a zone. Do not rely solely on port permissions. This may require SSL interception, and may also not be possible in all environments.

Rationale:

To avoid unintentionally exposing systems and services, rules allowing traffic from untrusted zones to trusted zones should be as specific as possible. Application-based rules, as opposed to service/port rules, further tighten what traffic is allowed to pass. Similarly, traffic from trusted to untrusted networks should have a security policy set, with application-based rules. A 'catch-all' rule that allows all applications will also allow malware traffic. The goal should be to understand both inbound and outbound traffic, permit what is known, and block all other traffic.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
      solution         : "Navigate to Policies > Security.
For all Security Policies that transit from a less trusted to a more trusted interface, set the Application and Service values to match the exposed application. For instance, for a web server exposed to the internet from a DMZ:
Source tab: Zone set to OUTSIDE / Address set to Any
Destination tab: Zone set to DMZ / Address set to [DMZ Host Object]
Application tab: set to web-browsing
Service/URL Category tab: set Service to ether:

application-default
or:

service-http and/or service-https

**Enhanced Security Recommendation: **
Set these values for Policies on all Interfaces, for traffic in all directions. For each Security Policy, set the Application and Service values to match the exposed application.

Impact:

Setting application based rules on both inbound and outbound traffic ensures that the traffic on the protocol and port being specified is actually the application that you expect. For outbound traffic, the days of 'we trust our users' is well past us, that statement also implies that we trust the malware on the user workstations, which is obviously not the case.
For traffic from trusted to less trusted interfaces, the applications should be characterized over time, with the end goal being that all applications in in the rules, and a final 'block all' rule is in place. Not having this goal gives both attackers and malware the leeway they need to accomplish their goals.
Trusting only Port permissions to control traffic exposes an organization to 'tunneling' style attacks that can exfiltrate data or facilitate Command and Control (C2) sessions.

Rationale:

App-ID requires a number of packets to traverse the firewall before an application can be identified and either allowed or dropped. Due to this behavior, even when an application is defined in a security policy, a service setting of any may allow a device in one zone to perform ports scans on IP addresses in a different zone. In addition, this recommendation helps to avoid an App-ID cache pollution attack.

Because of how App-ID works, configuring the service setting to 'Any' allows some initial traffic to reach the target host before App-ID can recognize and appropriately restrict the traffic. Setting the Service Setting to application specific at least restricts the traffic to the target applications or protocols for that initial volume of traffic."

Rationale:

Without SSL Inbound Inspection, the firewall is not able to protect SSL or TLS-enabled webservers against many threats.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
      solution         : "Navigate to Policies > Decryption.
Set SSL Inbound Inspection appropriately for all untrusted traffic destined for servers using SSL or TLS.
Navigate to Policies > Decryption. For each service published to the internet (or other untrusted zones), create a Policy and set the following options:

General tab: Name set to a descriptive name

Source: Source Zone set to the target zone (Internet in many cases). Source Address set to the target address space (Any for internet traffic)

Destination tab: Destination Zone should be set to the appropriate zone, or Any. Destination Address set to the target host address

Options tab: Type set to SSL Inbound Inspection

Impact:

Not decrypting inbound traffic to TLS encrypted services means that inspection for many common attacks cannot occur on the firewall. This means that all defenses against these attacks are up to the host.

Default Value:

Not Configured

      info             : "The CA Certificate used for in-line HTTP Man in the Middle should be trusted by target users. For SSL Forward Proxy configurations, there are classes of users that need to be considered.

1: Users that are members of the organization, users of machines under control of the organization. For these people and machines, ensure that the CA Certificate is in one of the Trusted CA certificate stores. This is easily done in Active Directory, using Group Policies for instance. A MDM (Mobile Device Manager) can be used to accomplish the same task for mobile devices such as telephones or tablets. Other central management or orchestration tools can be used for Linux or 'IoT' (Internet of Things) devices.

2: Users that are not member of the organization - often these are classed as 'Visitors' in the policies of the organization. If a public CA Certificate is a possibility for your organization, then that is one approach. A second approach is to not decrypt affected traffic - this is easily done, but leaves the majority of 'visitor' traffic uninspected and potentially carrying malicious content. The final approach, and the one most commonly seen, is to use the same certificate as is used for the hosting organization. In this last case, visitors will see a certificate warning, but the issuing CA will be the organization that they are visiting.

Rationale:

Using a self-signed certificate, or any certificate that generates a warning in the browser, means that members of the organization have no method of determining if they are being presented with a legitimate certificate, or an attacker's 'man in the middle' certificate. It also very rapidly teaches members of the organization to bypass all security warnings of this type.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
      solution         : "Set the CA Certificate(s):
Navigate to Device > Certificate Management > Certificates. Import the appropriate CA Certificates from any internal Certificate Authorities.
Alternatively, generate a self-signed certificate for an internal CA on the firewall, and then import the root certificate for that CA into the trusted CA list of target clients. In an Active Directory environment this can be facilitated using a Group Policy.
Set the Certificate Profile needed for the SSL Forward Proxy:

Navigate to Device > Certificate Management > Certificate Profile.

Set the decryption profile to include the settings described in the SSL Forward Proxy guidance in this document

Default Value:

Decryption is not enabled by default.
