  description      : "PANW-AG-000015 - The Palo Alto Networks security platform, if used to provide intermediary services for remote access communications traffic (TLS or SSL decryption), must ensure inbound and outbound traffic is monitored for compliance with remote access security policies - TLS/SSL must monitor traffic."
  info             : "Automated monitoring of remote access traffic allows organizations to detect cyber attacks and also ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies by inspecting connection activities of remote access capabilities.

Remote access methods include both unencrypted and encrypted traffic (e.g., web portals, web content filter, TLS, and webmail). With inbound TLS inspection, the traffic must be inspected prior to being allowed on the enclave's web servers hosting TLS or HTTPS applications. With outbound traffic inspection, traffic must be inspected prior to being forwarded to destinations outside of the enclave, such as external email traffic. This requirement does not mandate the decryption and inspection of SSL/TLS; it requires that if this is performed in the device, the decrypted traffic be inspected and conform to security policies.

If SSL/TLS traffic is decrypted in the device, it must be inspected.  The Palo Alto Networks security platform can be configured to decrypt and inspect SSL/TLS connections going through the device.  With SSL Decryption, SSL-encrypted traffic is decrypted and App-ID and the Antivirus, Vulnerability, Anti-Spyware, URL Filtering, and File-Blocking Profiles can be applied to decrypted traffic before being re-encrypted and being forwarded.  This is not limited to SSL encrypted HTTP traffic (HTTPS); other protocols 'wrapped' in SSL/TLS can be decrypted and inspected.

Decryption is policy-based and can be used to decrypt, inspect, and control both inbound and outbound SSL and SSH connections. Decryption policies allow the administrator to specify traffic for decryption according to destination, source, or URL category and in order to block or restrict the specified traffic according to security settings.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
  solution         : "Note: These instructions assume that certificates have already been loaded on the device.  Multiple decryption policies can be configured; these instructions explain the steps involved but do not provide specific details since the exact local policies are not known.  The Administrator must tailor the configuration to match the site-specific requirements.

Go to Policies >> Decryption
Select 'Add'.
In the 'Decryption Policy Rule' window, complete the required fields.
In the 'Name' tab, complete the 'Name' and 'Description' fields.
In the 'Source' tab, complete the 'Source Zone' and 'Source Address' or 'Source User' fields.
In the 'Destination' tab, complete the 'Destination Zone' and 'Destination Address' or 'Destination User' fields.
In the 'URL Category' tab, select which categories will be decrypted.
Select 'Any' to decrypt all traffic.  This is used for web traffic.
In the 'Option' tab, select 'Decrypt' as the Action.  Select the decryption profile.
In the Type field, there are three options;
Select 'SSL Forward Proxy to decrypt and inspect SSL/TLS traffic from internal users to outside networks'.
Select 'SSH Proxy to decrypt inbound and outbound SSH connections passing through the device'.
Select 'SSL Inbound Inspection to decrypt and inspect incoming SSL traffic'.

Note: This decryption mode can only work if you have control on the internal server certificate to import the Key Pair on Palo Alto Networks Device.

Decrypted traffic is blocked and restricted according to the policies configured on the firewall.  For each Decryption Policy, there must be a Security Policy in order to inspect and filter the decrypted traffic.  Multiple security policies can be configured; these instructions explain the steps involved but do not provide specific details since the exact local policies are not known.

Go to Policies >> Security
Select 'Add'.
In the 'Security Policy Rule' window, complete the required fields.
In the 'Name' tab, complete the 'Name' and 'Description' fields.
In the 'Source' tab, complete the 'Source Zone' and 'Source Address' fields.
In the 'User' tab, complete the 'Source User' and 'HIP Profile' fields.
In the 'Destination' tab, complete the 'Destination Zone' and 'Destination Address' fields.
In the 'Applications' tab, either select the 'Any' check box or add the specific applications.  Configured filters and groups can be selected.
In the 'Actions' tab, select the desired resulting action (allow or deny).  If logging of matches on the rule is required, select the 'Log forwarding' profile, and select 'Log at Session End'.

  info        : "In order to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information, or unauthorized tunneling (i.e., embedding of data types within data types); organizations must disable or restrict unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols on information systems.

The DoD continually assesses the ports, protocols, and services that can be used for network communications. Some ports, protocols, or services have known exploits or security weaknesses. Network traffic using these ports, protocols, and services must be prohibited or restricted in accordance with DoD policy. It is the responsibility of the enclave owner to have the applications the enclave uses registered in the PPSM database.

The Palo Alto Networks security platform must be configured to prevent or restrict the use of prohibited ports, protocols, and services throughout the network by filtering the network traffic and disallowing or redirecting traffic as necessary.  If the device is in a Deny-by-Default posture and what is allowed through the filter is IAW DoD Instruction 8551, and if the permit rule is explicitly defined with explicit ports and protocols allowed, then all requirements related to PPS being blocked are satisfied.

Since the enclave or system may support custom applications, it may be necessary to configure a Custom Application.  This requires detailed analysis of the application traffic and requires validation testing before deployment.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

  info             : "A variety of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and other attacks use 'botnets' as an attack vector.  A botnet is a collection of software agents (referred to as 'bot'), residing on compromised computers.  Attacks are orchestrated by a 'bot herder' to command these agents to launch attacks. Part of the command and control communication between the controller and the bots is a message sent from a bot that informs the controller that it is operating.  This is referred to as a 'phone home' message.

On the Palo Alto Networks security platform, a security policy can include an Anti-spyware Profile for 'phone home' detection (detection of traffic from installed spyware).  The device has two pre-configured Anti-spyware Profiles; Default and Strict.  The Default Anti-spyware Profile sends an alert for detected phone-home traffic for all severity levels except the low and informational severity threat levels, while the Strict Anti-spyware Profile blocks phone-home traffic for the critical, high, and medium severity threat levels.

Phone home traffic must either be blocked or intercepted by the DNS Sinkholing feature. Therefore, a custom Anti-spyware Profile or the Strict Anti-spyware Profile must be used instead of the Default Anti-spyware Profile.  Note that there are specific implementation requirements for DNS Sinkholing to operate properly; refer to the Palo Alto Networks documentation for details.

  info             : "A compromised host in an enclave can be used by a malicious actor as a platform to launch cyber attacks on third parties. This is a common practice in 'botnets', which are a collection of compromised computers using malware to attack (usually DDoS) other computers or networks. DDoS attacks frequently leverage IP source address spoofing, in which packets with false source IP addresses send traffic to multiple hosts, who then send return traffic to the hosts with the IP addresses that were forged. This can generate significant, even massive, amounts of traffic. Therefore, protection measures to counteract IP source address spoofing must be taken.

Enclaves must enforce egress filtering. In egress filtering, packets leaving the enclave are discarded if the source IP address is not part of the IP address network(s), also known as prefixes, which are assigned to the enclave. A more specific form of egress filtering is to allow only those hosts and protocols that have been identified and authorized to exit the enclave. All traffic leaving the enclave, regardless of the destination, must be filtered by the premise router's egress filter to verify that the source IP address belongs to the enclave.

Configure a security policy that allows only traffic originating from the IP address prefixes assigned to the enclave to exit the enclave.  The implicit deny cross zone traffic rule will then be used, in part, to deny illegitimate source address traffic originating from an internal zone to go to another zone.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

Note that the 15 minute period is a maximum value; Administrators can choose shorter timeout values to account for system- or network-specific requirements.

On a Palo Alto Networks security platform,  a session is defined by two uni-directional flows, each uniquely identified by a 6-tuple key: source-address, destination-address, source-port, destination-port, protocol, and security-zone.  Besides the six attributes that identify a session, each session has few more notable identifiers: end hosts - the source IP and destination IP which will be marked as client(source IP) and server(destination IP) and flow direction - each session is bi-directional and is identified by a two uni-directional flows, the first flow is client-to-server(c2s) and the returning flow is server-to-client(s2c).

Sessions between endpoints are kept active by either normal traffic or by keepalive messages (also sometimes referred to as heartbeat messages).  On the Palo Alto Networks security platform, the session timeout period is the time (seconds) required for the application to time out due to inactivity.

The Palo Alto Networks security platform allows customized profiles to be used to perform antivirus inspection for traffic between zones. Antivirus, anti-spyware, and vulnerability protection features require a specific license. There is a default Antivirus Profile; the profile inspects all of the listed protocol decoders for viruses, and generates alerts for SMTP, IMAP, and POP3 protocols while denying for FTP, HTTP, and SMB protocols. However, these default actions cannot be edited and the values for the FTP, HTTP, and SMB protocols do not meet the requirement, so customized profiles must be used.

PKIs lacking sufficient security controls and identity vetting procedures risk being compromised and issuing certificates that enable adversaries to impersonate legitimate users.

The authoritative list of DoD-approved PKIs is published at http://iase.disa.mil/pki-pke/interoperability. DoD-approved PKI CAs may include Category I, II, and III certificates. Category I DoD-Approved External PKIs are PIV issuers. Category II DoD-Approved External PKIs are Non-Federal Agency PKIs cross certified with the Federal Bridge Certification Authority (FBCA). Category III DoD-Approved External PKIs are Foreign, Allied, or Coalition Partner PKIs.

Deploying the ALG with TLS enabled will require the installation of DoD and/or DoD-Approved CA certificates in the trusted root certificate store of each proxy to be used for TLS traffic. If the Palo Alto Networks security platform is  used for TLS/SSL decryption, configure the Palo Alto Networks security platform to only accept end entity certificates issued by DoD PKI or DoD-approved PKI CAs for the establishment of protected sessions.

  info             : "If the network does not provide safeguards against DoS attacks, network resources may be unavailable to users. Installation of content filtering gateways and application-layer firewalls at key boundaries in the architecture mitigates the risk of DoS attacks. These attacks can be detected by matching observed communications traffic with patterns of known attacks and monitoring for anomalies in traffic volume/type.

Detection components that use rate-based behavior analysis can detect attacks when signatures for the attack do not exist or are not installed. These attacks include zero-day attacks that are new attacks for which vendors have not yet developed signatures. Rate-based behavior analysis can detect sophisticated, Distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks by correlating traffic information from multiple network segments or components.

PAN-OS can use either Zone-Based Protection or End Host Protection to mitigate DoS attacks.  Zone-Based Protection protects against most common floods, reconnaissance attacks and other packet-based attacks and is applied to any zone.  End Host Protection is specific to defined end hosts.

It is important to set the Flood Protection parameters that are suitable for the enclave or system.  The Administrator should characterize the traffic regularly (perform a traffic baseline) and tune these parameters based on that information.

  info        : "Only authorized personnel should be aware of errors and the details of the errors. Error messages are an indicator of an organization's operational state or can give configuration details about the network element.

The traceroute utility will display routes and trip times on an IP network.  An attacker can use traceroute responses to create a map of the subnets and hosts behind the boundary.  The traditional traceroute relies on TTL - time exceeded responses from network elements along the path and an ICMP port-unreachable message from the target host. In some Operating Systems such as UNIX, trace route will use UDP port 33400 and increment ports on each response.  Since blocking these UDP ports alone will not block trace route capabilities along with blocking potentially legitimate traffic on a network, it's unnecessary to block them explicitly.  Because traceroutes typically rely on ICMP Type 11 - Time exceeded message, the time exceeded message will be the target for implicitly or explicitly blocking outbound from the trusted network.
