Rationale:
Password complexity recommendations are derived from the USGCB (United States Government Configuration Baseline), Common Weakness Enumeration, and benchmarks published by the CIS (Center for Internet Security). Password complexity adds entropy to a password, in comparison to a simple password of the same length. A complex password is more difficult to attack, either directly against administrative interfaces or cryptographically, against captured password hashes. However, making a password of greater length will generally have a greater impact in this regard, in comparison to making a shorter password more complex."
      solution         : "Navigate to Device > Setup > Management > Minimum Password Complexity.
Set Enabled to be checked
Set that the various password settings to values that are appropriate to your organization. It is suggested that there at least be some special characters enforced, and that a minimum length be set. Ensure that non-zero values are set for Minimum Uppercase, Lowercase and Special Characters. \"Block Username Inclusion\" should be enabled.
Operationally, dictionary words should be avoided for all passwords - passphrases are a much better alternative.

Impact:
Simple passwords make an attacker's job very easy. There is a reasonably short list of commonly used admin passwords for network infrastructure, not enforcing password lengths and complexity can lend itself to making an attacker's brute force attack successful.
Default Value:
Not enabled."

Increasing file size limits allows the devices to forward more files for WildFire analysis. This increases the chances of identifying, and later preventing, threats in larger files. The default values are configured for files small enough that the majority of files are not assessed by Wildfire.

      info             : "Enable the SYN Flood Action of SYN Cookies for all untrusted zones. The Alert, Activate, and Maximum settings for SYN Flood Protection depend highly on the environment and device used. Perform traffic analysis on the specific environment and firewall to determine accurate thresholds. Do not rely on default values to be appropriate for an environment.
Setting these values for all interfaces is an approach that should be considered by many organizations, as traffic floods can result from internal testing or malware as well.
As a rough ballpark for most environments, an Activate value of 50% of the firewalls maximum New sessions per second/CPS is a conservative setting. The following is a list of new sessions per second maximum for each platform:
PA-200 = 1,000 CPS
PA-500 = 7,500 CPS
PA-2000 series = 15,000 CPS
PA-3000 series = 50,000 CPS
PA-5000 series = 120,000 CPS
PA-7050 = 720,000 CPS
Rationale:
Protecting resources and the firewall itself against DoS/DDoS attacks requires a layered approach. Firewalls alone cannot mitigate all DoS attacks, however, many attacks can be successfully mitigated. Utilizing SYN Cookies helps to mitigate SYN flood attacks, where the CPU and/or memory buffers of the victim device become overwhelmed by incomplete TCP sessions. SYN Cookies are preferred over Random Early Drop."
      solution         : "From GUI:
Navigate to Network > Network Profiles > Zone Protection > Zone Protection Profile > Flood Protection tab.
Check the SYN box Set the Action dropdown to SYN Cookies Set Alert to 20000(or appropriate for org) Set Activate to 25000(50% of maximum for firewall model) Set Maximum to 1000000(or appropriate for org)
Impact:
Not configuring a Network Zone Protection Profile on untrusted interfaces leaves an organization exposed to common attacks and reconnaissance from those untrusted networks. Not configuring a Zone Protection Profile for internal networks leaves an organization vulnerable to malware, software or hardware causes of traffic flooding from internal sources.

Rationale:
To avoid unintentionally exposing systems and services, rules allowing traffic from untrusted zones to trusted zones should be as specific as possible. Application-based rules, as opposed to service/port rules, further tighten what traffic is allowed to pass. Similarly, traffic from trusted to untrusted networks should have a security policy set, with application-based rules. A \"catch-all\" rule that allows all applications will also allow malware traffic. The goal should be to understand both inbound and outbound traffic, permit what is known, and block all other traffic.

Impact:
Setting application based rules on both inbound and outbound traffic ensures that the traffic on the protocol and port being specified is actually the application that you expect. For outbound traffic, the days of \"we trust our users\" is well past us, that statement also implies that we trust the malware on the user workstations, which is obviously not the case.
For traffic from trusted to less trusted interfaces, the applications should be characterized over time, with the end goal being that all applications in in the rules, and a final \"block all\" rule is in place. Not having this goal gives both attackers and malware the leeway they need to accomplish their goals.

Rationale:
App-ID requires a number of packets to traverse the firewall before an application can be identified and either allowed or dropped. Due to this behavior, even when an application is defined in a security policy, a service setting of any may allow a device in one zone to perform ports scans on IP addresses in a different zone. In addition, this recommendation helps to avoid an App-ID cache pollution attack.
Because of how App-ID works, configuring the service setting to \"Any\" allows some initial traffic to reach the target host before App-ID can recognize and appropriately restrict the traffic. Setting the Service Setting to application specific at least restricts the traffic to the target applications or protocols for that initial volume of traffic."

      description      : "8.3 Ensure that the Certificate used for Decryption is Trusted"
      info             : "The CA Certificate used for in-line HTTP Man in the Middle should be trusted by target users. There are two classes of users that need to be considered.
1: Users that are members of the organization, users of machines under control of the organization. For these people and machines, ensure that the CA Certificate is in one of the Trusted CA certificate stores. This is easily done in Active Directory, using Group Policies for instance. A MDM (Mobile Device Manager) can be used to accomplish the same task for mobile devices such as telephones or tablets. Other central management or orchestration tools can be used for Linux or \"IoT\" (Internet of Things) devices.
2: Users that are not member of the organization - often these are classed as \"Visitors\" in the policies of the organization. If a public CA Certificate is a possibility for your organization, then that is one approach. A second approach is to not decrypt affected traffic - this is easily done, but leaves the majority of \"visitor\" traffic uninspected and potentially carrying malicious content. The final approach, and the one most commonly seen, is to use the same certificate as is used for members organization. In this last case, visitors will see a certificate warning, but the issuing CA will be the organization that they are visiting.
Rationale:
Using a self-signed certificate, or any certificate that generates a warning in the browser, means that members of the organization have no method of determining if they are being presented with a legitimate certificate, or an attacker's \"man in the middle' certificate. It also very rapidly teaches members of the organization to bypass all security warnings of this type.
NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
      solution         : "Set the CA Certificate(s):
Navigate to Device > Certificate Management > Certificates.
Set the Certificate Profile needed for the SSL Forward Proxy:
Navigate to Device > Certificate Management > Certificate Profile.
Set the decryption profile to include the settings described in the SSL Forward Proxy guidance in this document:
Navigate to Objects > Decryption Profile.
Set the Decryption Policy to be applied to the appropriate interfaces and to have the categories assigned to it that comply with your organization's internal policies, regulatory requirements and legal requirements.
Navigate to Policies > Decryption.
Source: all internal user subnets.
Destination: all target zones (typically this is the public internet).
Excluded URL categories: include Health Care, Personal Banking and any other category that exposes PII, PHI or that exposes any information that might be described in your organization's internal policies, regulatory framework, privacy requirements or legal requirements as protected.
Decryption Policy Rule: include the SSL Forward Proxy defined above, and the Decryption Profile defined above.

Default Value:
Decryption is not enabled by default."
