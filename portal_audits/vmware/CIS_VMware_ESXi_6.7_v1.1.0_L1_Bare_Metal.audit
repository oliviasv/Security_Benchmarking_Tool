  description : "1.2 Ensure the Image Profile VIB acceptance level is configured properly"
  info        : "A VIB (vSphere Installation Bundle) is a collection of files that are packaged into an archive. The VIB contains a signature file that is used to verify the level of trust. The ESXi Image Profile supports four VIB acceptance levels:

VMware Certified - VIBs created, tested, and signed by VMware

VMware Accepted - VIBs created by a VMware partner but tested and signed by VMware

Partner Supported - VIBs created, tested, and signed by a certified VMware partner

Community Supported - VIBs that have not been tested by VMware or a VMware partner

Rationale:

The ESXi Image Profile should only allow signed VIBs because an unsigned VIB represents untested code installed on an ESXi host. Also, use of unsigned VIBs will cause hypervisor Secure Boot to fail to configure. Community Supported VIBs do not have digital signatures. To protect the security and integrity of your ESXi hosts, do not allow unsigned (CommunitySupported) VIBs to be installed on your hosts."
  solution    : "To implement the recommended configuration state, run the following PowerCLI command (in the example code, the level is Partner Supported):

# Set the Software AcceptanceLevel for each host<span>
Foreach ($VMHost in Get-VMHost ) {
 $ESXCli = Get-EsxCli -VMHost $VMHost
 $ESXCli.software.acceptance.Set('PartnerSupported')
}




Default Value:

Partner Supported

Rationale:

VMware provides digital signatures for kernel modules. Untested or malicious kernel modules loaded on the ESXi host can put the host at risk for instability and/or exploitation.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

  info        : "The default certificate is self-signed, not signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA). It should be replaced with a valid certificate issued by a trusted CA.

Rationale:

Using the default self-signed certificate may increase risk related to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
  solution    : "Backup and replace the details of the SSL certificate presented by the ESXi host and determine if it is issued by a trusted CA:

Log in to the ESXi Shell, either directly from the DCUI or from an SSH client, as a user with administrator privileges.

In the directory /etc/vmware/ssl, rename the existing certificates using the following commands:

mv rui.crt orig.rui.crt
mv rui.key orig.rui.key

Copy the certificates you want to use to /etc/vmware/ssl.

Rename the new certificate and key to rui.crt and rui.key.

Restart the host after you install the new certificate.

Alternatively, you can put the host into maintenance mode, install the new certificate, use the Direct Console User Interface (DCUI) to restart the management agents, and set the host to exit maintenance mode.

Leverage VMware's SSL Certificate Automation Tool to install CA-signed SSL certificates. For more information on this tool, please see [http://kb.vmware.com/kb/2057340](http://kb.vmware.com/kb/2057340).

Impact:

Replacing the default certificate might cause vCenter Server to stop managing the host. Disconnect and reconnect the host if vCenter Server cannot verify the new certificate.

  info        : "By default, ESXi hosts do not have Certificate Revocation List (CRL) checking available, so expired and revoked SSL certificates must be checked and removed manually.

Rationale:

Leaving expired and revoked certificates on your vCenter Server system can compromise your environment. Replacing certificates will avoid having users get used to clicking through browser warnings. The warning might be an indication of a man-in-the-middle attack, and only inspection of the certificate and thumbprint can guard against such attacks.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
  solution    : "Replace expired and revoked certificates with certificates from a trusted CA. Certificates can be replaced in a number of ways:
Replace a Default ESXi Certificate and Key from the ESXi Shell

Log in to the ESXi Shell, either directly from the DCUI or from an SSH client, as a user with administrator privileges.

In the directory /etc/vmware/ssl, rename the existing certificates using the following commands:

mv rui.crt orig.rui.crt
mv rui.key orig.rui.key

Alternatively, you can put the host into maintenance mode, install the new certificate, use the Direct Console User Interface (DCUI) to restart the management agents, and set the host to exit maintenance mode.
Replace a Default ESI Certificate and Key by Using the vifs Command

Back up the existing certificates.

Generate a certificate request following the instructions from the certificate authority.

At the command line, use the vifs command to upload the certificate to the appropriate location on the host.

vifs --server hostname --username username --put rui.crt /host/ssl_cert
vifs --server hostname --username username --put rui.key /host/ssl_key

Restart the host.




Alternatively, you can put the host into maintenance mode, install the new certificate, and then use the Direct Console User Interface (DCUI) to restart the management agents.
Replace A Default ESI Certificate and Key Using HTTP PUT

Back up the existing certificates.

In your upload application, process each file as follows:

Open the file.

Publish the file to one of these locations:

Certificates   https://hostname/host/ssl_cert
Keys   https://hostname/host/ssl_key

The locations /host/ssl_cert and host/ssl_key link to the certificate files in /etc/vmware/ssl.

Restart the host.

  info        : "The VMware vSphere Network Dump Collector service allows for collecting diagnostic information from a host that experiences a critical fault. This service provides a centralized location for collecting ESXi host core dumps.

Rationale:

When a host crashes, an analysis of the resultant core dump is essential to being able to identify the cause of the crash and determine a resolution. Installing a centralized dump collector helps ensure that core files are successfully saved and made available in the event an ESXi host should ever panic."

Rationale:

To avoid sharing a common root account, it is recommended on each host to create at least one named user account and assign it full admin privileges, and to use this account in lieu of a shared 'root' account. Limit the use of 'root', including setting a highly complex password for the account, but do not remove the 'root' account.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
  solution    : "To create one or more named user accounts (local ESXi user accounts), perform the following using the vSphere client (not the vSphere web client) for each ESXi host:

Connect directly to the ESXi host using the vSphere Client.

Login as root.

Select Manage, then select the Security & Users tab.

Select User and view the local users.

Add a local user and grant shell access to this user.

Select the Host, then select 'Actions' and 'Permissions'.

Assign the 'Administrator' role to the user.

Notes:

Even if you add your ESXi host to an Active Directory domain, it is still recommended to add at least one local user account to ensure admins can still login in the event the host ever becomes isolated and unable to access Active Directory.

Adding local user accounts can be automated using Host Profiles.

  description : "4.3 Ensure Active Directory is used for local user authentication"
  info        : "ESXi can be configured to use a directory service such as Active Directory to manage users and groups. It is recommended that a directory service be used.

Note: If the AD group 'ESX Admins' (default) is created, all users and groups that are members of this group will have full administrative access to all ESXi hosts in the domain.

Rationale:

Joining ESXi hosts to an Active Directory (AD) domain eliminates the need to create and maintain multiple local user accounts. Using AD for user authentication simplifies the ESXi host configuration, ensures password complexity and reuse policies are enforced, and reduces the risk of security breaches and unauthorized access."
  solution    : "To use AD for local user authentication, perform the following from the vSphere Web Client:

Select the host and go to 'Manage' -> 'Security & Users' -> 'Authentication'.

Click the 'Join Domain' button.

Provide the domain name along with the user credentials for an AD user that has the rights to join computers to the domain.

Click 'OK'.

Alternately, run the following PowerCLI command:

# Join the ESXI Host to the Domain
Get-VMHost HOST1 | Get-VMHostAuthentication | Set-VMHostAuthentication -Domain domain.local -User Administrator -Password Passw0rd -JoinDomain

Notes:

Host Profiles can be used to automate adding hosts to an AD domain.

Consider using the vSphere Authentication proxy to avoid transmitting AD credentials over the network.
