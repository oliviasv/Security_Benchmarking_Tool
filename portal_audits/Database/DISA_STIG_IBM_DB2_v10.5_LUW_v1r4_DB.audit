Unlimited concurrent connections to the DBMS could allow a successful Denial of Service (DoS) attack by exhausting connection resources; and a system can also fail or be degraded by an overload of legitimate users. Limiting the number of concurrent sessions per user is helpful in reducing these risks.

This requirement addresses concurrent session control for a single account. It does not address concurrent sessions by a single user via multiple system accounts; and it does not deal with the total number of sessions across all accounts.

The capability to limit the number of concurrent sessions per user must be configured in or added to the DBMS (for example, by use of a logon trigger), when this is technically feasible. Note that it is not sufficient to limit sessions via a web server or application server alone, because legitimate users and adversaries can potentially connect to the DBMS by other means.

The organization will need to define the maximum number of concurrent sessions by account type, by account, or a combination thereof. In deciding on the appropriate number, it is important to consider the work requirements of the various types of users. For example, 2 might be an acceptable limit for general users accessing the database via an application; but 10 might be too few for a database administrator using a database management GUI tool, where each query tab and navigation pane may count as a separate session.

  description : "DB2X-00-000300 - DB2 must integrate with an organization-level authentication/access mechanism providing account management and automation for all users, groups, roles, and any other principals - ldap enabled"
  info        : "Enterprise environments make account management for applications and databases challenging and complex. A manual process for account management functions adds the risk of a potential oversight or other error. Managing accounts for the same person in multiple places is inefficient and prone to problems with consistency and synchronization.

A comprehensive application account management process that includes automation helps to ensure that accounts designated as requiring attention are consistently and promptly addressed.

Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended, or terminated, or by disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores, such as multiple servers. Account management functions can also include: assignment of group or role membership; identifying account type; specifying user access authorizations (i.e., privileges); account removal, update, or termination; and administrative alerts. The use of automated mechanisms can include, for example: using email or text messaging to notify account managers when users are terminated or transferred; using the information system to monitor account usage; and using automated telephone notification to report atypical system account usage.

The DBMS must be configured to automatically utilize organization-level account management functions, and these functions must immediately enforce the organization's current account policy.

Automation may be comprised of differing technologies that when placed together contain an overall mechanism supporting an organization's automated account management requirements."
  solution    : "Create an IBMLDAPSecurity.ini file at the default name and location for the IBM LDAP security plug-in configuration file:

    On UNIX/LINUX:  $INSTHOME/sqllib/cfg/IBMLDAPSecurity.ini
    On Windows:  %DB2PATH%\cfg\IBMLDAPSecurity.ini

To create the file in a non-default location, set the environment variable DB2LDAPSecurityConfig to the directory name where configuration file IBMLDAPSecurity.ini is located.

Set the value of SRVCON_PW_PLUGIN to IBMLDAPauthserver for instance by running the following command:

     $db2 update dbm cfg using SRVCON_PW_PLUGIN IBMLDAPauthserver immediate

Refer to details below to determine appropriate values in LDAP configuration file.

-- SERVER-RELATED values:
1) LDAP_HOST - The name of the LDAP server(s) - This is a space separated list of LDAP server host names or IP addresses, with an optional port number for each one.

For example: host1[:port1] [host2:[port2] ... The default port number is 389, or 636 if SSL is enabled.

2) ENABLE_SSL - To enable SSL support, set ENABLE_SSL to TRUE (you must have the GSKit installed). This is an optional parameter; it defaults to FALSE (no SSL support).

3) SSL_KEYFILE - The path for the SSL keyring. A keyfile is only required if your LDAP server is using a certificate that is not automatically trusted by your GSKit installation.

For example: SSL_KEYFILE = /home/db2inst1/IBMLDAPSecurity.kdb

4) SSL_PW - The SSL keyring password. For example: SSL_PW = keyfile-password

5) SECURITY_PROTOCOL - To enable TLS 1.2 support, set SECURITY_PROTOCOL to TLSV12. To enable TLS 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 support, set SECURITY_PROTOCOL to ALL.

By default, SECURITY_PROTOCOL is not set. This setting means TLS 1.2 is not supported.

-- USER_RELATED values:
1) USER_OBJECTCLASS - The LDAP object class used for users.

Generally, set USER_OBJECTCLASS to inetOrgPerson (the user for Microsoft Active Directory)

For example: USER_OBJECTCLASS = inetOrgPerson

2) USER_BASEDN -  The LDAP base DN to use when searching for users. If not specified, user searches start at the root of the LDAP directory. Some LDAP servers require that you specify a value for this parameter.

For example: USER_BASEDN = o=ibm

3) USERID_ATTRIBUTE - The LDAP user attribute that represents the user ID. The USERID_ATTRIBUTE attribute is combined with the USER_OBJECTCLASS and USER_BASEDN (if specified) to construct an LDAP search filter when a user issues a DB2 CONNECT statement with an unqualified user ID.

For example, if USERID_ATTRIBUTE = uid, then issuing this statement: db2 connect to MYDB user bob using bobpass results in the following search filter:
&(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)(uid=bob)

4) AUTHID_ATTRIBUTE - The LDAP user attribute that represents the DB2 authorization ID. Usually this is the same as the USERID_ATTRIBUTE.
For example: AUTHID_ATTRIBUTE = uid

-- GROUP-RELATED values:
1) GROUP_OBJECTCLASS - The LDAP object class used for groups. Generally this is groupOfNames or groupOfUniqueNames
(for Microsoft Active Directory, it is group)

For example: GROUP_OBJECTCLASS = groupOfNames

2) GROUP_BASEDN - The LDAP base DN to use when searching for groups If not specified, group searches start at the root of the LDAP directory. Some LDAP servers require that you specify a value for this parameter.

For example: GROUP_BASEDN = o=ibm

3) GROUPNAME_ATTRIBUTE - The LDAP group attribute that represents the name of the group.

For example: GROUPNAME_ATTRIBUTE = cn

4) GROUP_LOOKUP_ METHOD - Determines the method used to find the group memberships for a user.
Possible values are:
SEARCH_BY_DN Indicates to search for groups that list the user as a member. Membership is indicated by the group attribute defined as GROUP_LOOKUP_ATTRIBUTE (typically, member or uniqueMember).

USER_ATTRIBUTE In this case, a user's groups are listed as attributes of the user object itself. This setting indicates to search for the user attribute defined as GROUP_LOOKUP_ATTRIBUTE to get the user's groups (typically memberOf for Microsoft Active Directory or ibm-allGroups for IBM Tivoli Directory Server).

For example: GROUP_LOOKUP_METHOD = SEARCH_BY_DN
GROUP_LOOKUP_METHOD = USER_ATTRIBUTE

5) GROUP_LOOKUP_ATTRIBUTE - Name of the attribute used to determine group membership, as described for GROUP_LOOKUP_METHOD.

For example:
GROUP_LOOKUP_ATTRIBUTE = member
GROUP_LOOKUP_ATTRIBUTE = ibm-allGroups
NESTED_GROUPS If NESTED_GROUPS is TRUE, the DB2 database manager recursively searches for group membership by attempting to look up the group memberships for every group that is found.

Cycles (such as A belongs to B, and B belongs to A) are handled correctly.
This parameter is optional, and defaults to FALSE.

-- MISCELLANEOUS  values:
1) SEARCH_DN, SEARCH_PW If your LDAP server does not support anonymous access, or if anonymous access is not sufficient when searching for users or groups, then you can optionally define a DN and password that will be used to perform searches.

For example:
SEARCH_DN = cn=root
SEARCH_PW = rootpassword

2) DEBUG  Set DEBUG to TRUE to write extra information to the db2diag log files to aid in debugging LDAP related issues.

Most of the additional information is logged at
DIAGLEVEL 4 (INFO).
DEBUG defaults to false."

  info        : "Authentication with a DoD-approved PKI certificate does not necessarily imply authorization to access the DBMS.  To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DoD-approved PKIs, all DoD systems, including databases, must be properly configured to implement access control policies.

Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement.

Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system.

This requirement is applicable to access control enforcement applications, a category that includes database management systems.  If the DBMS does not follow applicable policy when approving access, it may be in conflict with networks or other applications in the information system. This may result in users either gaining or being denied access inappropriately and in conflict with applicable policy."
  solution    : "If a privilege is granted directly to PUBLIC, revoke it using the appropriate variation of the REVOKE statement specific to the object on which the privilege is granted. For example, if PUBLIC has EXECUTE privileges are on a package X.Y, revoke them using the REVOKE (package privileges).

DB2> REVOKE EXECUTE ON PACKAGE X.Y FROM PUBLIC

If a privilege has been granted indirectly to PUBLIC through membership in a database role, revoke membership in that database role from PUBLIC using the REVOKE (role) statement.

DB2> REVOKE ROLE <role name> FROM PUBLIC

If an authority is granted directly to PUBLIC, revoke it using the appropriate variation of the REVOKE (database authorities) statement. For example, if the CONNECT row shows a 'Y' value in the D_PUBLIC column, revoke CONNECT authority using this statement:

DB2> REVOKE CONNECT ON DATABASE FROM PUBLIC

If an authority is granted indirectly to PUBLIC through a database role, revoke membership in that database role from PUBLIC using the REVOKE (role) statement.

DB2> REVOKE ROLE <role name> FROM PUBLIC

Audit records can be generated from various components within the DBMS (e.g., process, module). Certain specific application functionalities may be audited as well. The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events for which the system is capable of generating audit records.

DoD has defined the list of events for which the DBMS will provide an audit record generation capability as the following:

(i) Successful and unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete privileges, security objects, security levels, or categories of information (e.g., classification levels);
(ii) Access actions, such as successful and unsuccessful logon attempts, privileged activities, or other system-level access, starting and ending time for user access to the system, concurrent logons from different workstations, successful and unsuccessful accesses to objects, all program initiations, and all direct access to the information system; and
(iii) All account creation, modification, disabling, and termination actions.

Organizations may define additional events requiring continuous or ad hoc auditing."

Reconstruction of harmful events or forensic analysis is not possible if audit records do not contain enough information. To support analysis, some types of events will need information to be logged that exceeds the basic requirements of event type, time stamps, location, source, outcome, and user identity. If additional information is not available, it could negatively impact forensic investigations into user actions or other malicious events.

The organization must determine what additional information is required for complete analysis of the audited events. The additional information required is dependent on the type of information (e.g., sensitivity of the data and the environment within which it resides). At a minimum, the organization must employ either full-text recording of privileged commands or the individual identities of group users, or both. The organization must maintain audit trails in sufficient detail to reconstruct events to determine the cause and impact of compromise.

Examples of detailed information the organization may require in audit records are full-text recording of privileged commands or the individual identities of group account users.

If an attacker were to gain access to audit tools, he could analyze audit logs for system weaknesses or weaknesses in the auditing itself. An attacker could also manipulate logs to hide evidence of malicious activity.

  info        : "Invalid user input occurs when a user inserts data or characters into an application's data entry fields and the application is unprepared to process that data. This results in unanticipated application behavior, potentially leading to an application or information system compromise. Invalid user input is one of the primary methods employed when attempting to compromise an application.

With respect to database management systems, one class of threat is known as SQL Injection, or more generally, code injection. It takes advantage of the dynamic execution capabilities of various programming languages, including dialects of SQL. Potentially, the attacker can gain unauthorized access to data, including security settings, and severely corrupt or destroy the database.

Even when no such hijacking takes place, invalid input that gets recorded in the database, whether accidental or malicious, reduces the reliability and usability of the system.

Use strongly typed data items rather than general-purpose strings as input parameters to task-specific, pre-compiled stored procedures and functions (and triggers).

When dynamic execution is necessary, ways to mitigate the risk include the following, which should be implemented both in the on-screen application and at the database level, in the stored procedures:
-- Allow strings as input only when necessary.
-- Rely on data typing to validate numbers, dates, etc. Do not accept invalid values. If substituting other values for them, think carefully about whether this could be subverted.
-- Limit the size of input strings to what is truly necessary.
-- If single quotes/apostrophes, double quotes, semicolons, equals signs, angle brackets, or square brackets will never be valid as input, reject them.
-- If comment markers will never be valid as input, reject them. In SQL, these are -- or /* */
-- If HTML and XML tags, entities, comments, etc., will never be valid, reject them.
-- If wildcards are present, reject them unless truly necessary. In SQL these are the underscore and the percentage sign, and the word ESCAPE is also a clue that wildcards are in use.
-- If SQL key words, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, DROP, ESCAPE, UNION, GRANT, REVOKE, DENY, MODIFY will never be valid, reject them. Use case-insensitive comparisons when searching for these. Bear in mind that some of these words, particularly Grant (as a person's name), could also be valid input.
-- If there are range limits on the values that may be entered, enforce those limits.
-- Institute procedures for inspection of programs for correct use of dynamic coding, by a party other than the developer.
-- Conduct rigorous testing of program modules that use dynamic coding, searching for ways to subvert the intended use.
-- Record the inspection and testing in the system documentation.
-- Bear in mind that all this applies not only to screen input, but also to the values in an incoming message to a web service or to a stored procedure called by a software component that has not itself been hardened in these ways. Not only can the caller be subject to such vulnerabilities; it may itself be the attacker.

Some default DBMS error messages can contain information that could aid an attacker in, among others things, identifying the database type, host address, or state of the database. Custom errors may contain sensitive customer information.

It is important that detailed error messages be visible only to those who are authorized to view them; that general users receive only generalized acknowledgment that errors have occurred; and that these generalized messages appear only when relevant to the user's task. For example, a message along the lines of, 'An error has occurred. Unable to save your changes. If this problem persists, contact your help desk' would be relevant. A message such as 'Warning: your transaction generated a large number of page splits' would likely not be relevant.

System documentation should include a definition of the functionality considered privileged.

Depending on circumstances, privileged functions can include, for example, establishing accounts, performing system integrity checks, or administering cryptographic key management activities. Non-privileged users are individuals that do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users.

A privileged function in the DBMS/database context is any operation that modifies the structure of the database, its built-in logic, or its security settings. This would include all Data Definition Language (DDL) statements and all security-related statements. In an SQL environment, it encompasses, but is not necessarily limited to:

CREATE
ALTER
DROP
GRANT
REVOKE
DENY

There may also be Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements that, subject to context, should be regarded as privileged. Possible examples include:

TRUNCATE TABLE;
DELETE, or
DELETE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or
DELETE without a WHERE clause;

UPDATE or
UPDATE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or
UPDATE without a WHERE clause;

any SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE to an application-defined security table executed by other than a security principal.

Depending on the capabilities of the DBMS and the design of the database and associated applications, the prevention of unauthorized use of privileged functions may be achieved by means of DBMS security features, database triggers, other mechanisms, or a combination of these.

System documentation should include a definition of the functionality considered privileged.

Depending on circumstances, privileged functions can include, for example, establishing accounts, performing system integrity checks, or administering cryptographic key management activities. Non-privileged users are individuals that do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users.

A privileged function in the DBMS/database context is any operation that modifies the structure of the database, its built-in logic, or its security settings. This would include all Data Definition Language (DDL) statements and all security-related statements. In an SQL environment, it encompasses, but is not necessarily limited to:

CREATE
ALTER
DROP
GRANT
REVOKE
DENY

There may also be Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements that, subject to context, should be regarded as privileged. Possible examples include:

TRUNCATE TABLE;
DELETE, or
DELETE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or
DELETE without a WHERE clause;

UPDATE or
UPDATE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or
UPDATE without a WHERE clause;

any SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE to an application-defined security table executed by other than a security principal.

Depending on the capabilities of the DBMS and the design of the database and associated applications, the prevention of unauthorized use of privileged functions may be achieved by means of DBMS security features, database triggers, other mechanisms, or a combination of these.

A privileged function in the DBMS/database context is any operation that modifies the structure of the database, its built-in logic, or its security settings.

UPDATE affecting more than n rows, for some n, or

     $gsk8capicmd_64 -keydb -create -db 'mydbserver.kdb' -pw 'myServerPassw0rdpw0' -stash

When you create a key database, it is automatically populated with signer certificates from a few certificate authorities (CAs), such as Verisign.

Add a certificate for your server to your key database.

To obtain a certificate, you can either use GSKCapiCmd to create a new certificate request and submit it to a CA to be signed, or you can create a self-signed certificate for testing purposes.

Following is an example of command to create a self-signed certificate with a label of myselfsigned, use the GSKCapiCmd command as shown in the following command:

     $gsk8capicmd_64 -cert -create -db 'mydbserver.kdb' -pw 'myServerPassw0rdpw0' -label 'myselfsigned' -dn 'CN=myhost.mycompany.com,O=myOrganization, OU=myOrganizationUnit,L=myLocation,ST=ON,C=CA'

Notes:

-- Use the GSKCapiCmd tool to create the key database. It must be a Certificate Management System (CMS) type key database.

The GSKCapiCmd is a non-Java-based command-line tool, and Java does not need to be installed on the system to use this tool.

You invoke GSKCapiCmd using the GSKCAPICMD command, as described in the GSKCapiCmd User's Guide.

The path for the command is sqllib/gskit/bin on Linux and UNIX platforms, and C:\Program Files\IBM\GSK8\bin on both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows platforms.

On 64-bit platforms, the 32-bit GSKit executable files and libraries are also present; in this case, the path for the command is C:\ProgramFiles (x86)\IBM\GSK8\bin. - Ensure PATH (on the Windows platform) includes the proper GSKit library path, and LIBPATH, SHLIB_PATH, or LD_LIBRARY_PATH (on UNIX or Linux platforms) include the proper GSKit library path, such as sqllib/lib64/gskit.
The -stash option creates a stash file at the same path as the key database, with a file extension of .sth. At instance start-up, GSKit uses the stash file to obtain the password to the key database.
To extract the certificate you created to a file, so that you can distribute it to computers running clients that will be establishing SSL connections to your DB2 server.

  info        : "A common vulnerability is unplanned behavior when invalid inputs are received. This requirement guards against adverse or unintended system behavior caused by invalid inputs, where information system responses to the invalid input may be disruptive or cause the system to fail into an unsafe state.

The behavior will be derived from the organizational and system requirements and includes, but is not limited to, notification of the appropriate personnel, creating an audit record, and rejecting invalid input.

This calls for the review of applications, which will require collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers, and may have limited, if any, access to source code. Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored. At a minimum, the DBA must attempt to obtain assurances from the development organization that this issue is addressed, and must document what has been discovered.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

  info        : "Security flaws with software applications, including database management systems, are discovered daily. Vendors are constantly updating and patching their products to address newly discovered security vulnerabilities. Organizations (including any contractor to the organization) are required to promptly install security-relevant software updates (e.g., patches, service packs, and hot fixes). Flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system error handling must also be addressed expeditiously.

Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software may vary based on a variety of factors including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw).

This requirement will apply to software patch management solutions that are used to install patches across the enclave and also to applications themselves that are not part of that patch management solution. For example, many browsers today provide the capability to install their own patch software. Patch criticality, as well as system criticality, will vary. Therefore, the tactical situations regarding the patch management process will also vary. This means that the time period utilized must be a configurable parameter. Time frames for application of security-relevant software updates may be dependent upon the Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) process.

The application will be configured to check for and install security-relevant software updates within an identified time period from the availability of the update. The specific time period will be defined by an authoritative source (e.g. IAVM, CTOs, DTMs, and STIGs).
