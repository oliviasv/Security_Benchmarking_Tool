  description : "SQL4-00-002000 - SQL Server must enforce approved authorizations for logical access to information and database-level system resources"
  info        : "Authentication with a DoD-approved PKI certificate does not necessarily imply authorization to access the database and all its contents.  To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DoD-approved PKIs, all DoD systems, including SQL Server databases, must be properly configured to implement access control policies.   Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement.   Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography. These policies and mechanisms must be employed by the application to control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users) and objects (e.g., devices, files, records, processes, programs, and domains) in the information system.  This requirement is applicable to access control enforcement applications, a category that includes SQL Server.  If SQL Server is not configured to follow applicable policy when approving access, it may be in conflict with networks or other applications in the information system. This may result in users either gaining or being denied access inappropriately and in conflict with applicable policy.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

  info        : "SQL Server's fixed (built-in) server roles, especially [sysadmin], have powerful capabilities that could cause great harm if misused, so their use must be tightly controlled.  The SQL Server instance uses each database's TRUSTWORTHY property to guard against tampering that could enable unwarranted privilege escalation. When TRUSTWORTHY is 0/False/Off, SQL Server prevents the database from accessing resources in other databases. When TRUSTWORTHY is 1/True/On, SQL Server permits access to other databases (subject to other protections). SQL Server sets TRUSTWORTHY OFF when it creates a new database. SQL Server forces TRUSTWORTHY OFF, irrespective of its prior value, when an existing database is attached to it, to address the possibility that an adversary may have tampered with the database, introducing malicious code. To set TRUSTWORTHY ON, an account with the [sysadmin] role must issue an ALTER DATABASE command.  Although SQL Server itself treats this property conservatively, application installer programs may set TRUSTWORTHY ON and leave it on. This provides an opportunity for misuse.  When TRUSTWORTHY is ON, users of the database can take advantage of the database owner's privileges, by impersonating the owner. This can have particularly serious consequences if the database owner is the [sa] login (which may have been renamed in accordance with SQL4-00-010200, and disabled in accordance with SQL4-00-017100, but nonetheless can be invoked in an EXECUTE AS USER = 'dbo' statement, or CREATE PROCEDURE ... WITH EXECUTE AS OWNER ...). The [sa] login cannot be removed from the [sysadmin] role. The user impersonating [sa] - or another [sysadmin] account - is then able to perform administrative actions across all databases under the instance, including making any himself or any other login a member of [sysadmin].  Most of the other fixed server roles could be similarly abused.  Therefore, TRUSTWORTHY must not be used on databases owned by logins that are members of the fixed server roles. Further, if TRUSTWORTHY is to be used for any other database, the need must be documented and approved.  The system database [msdb] is an exception: it is required to be TRUSTWORTHY."

  info        : "SQL Server's fixed (built-in) server roles, especially [sysadmin], have powerful capabilities that could cause great harm if misused, so their use must be tightly controlled.  The SQL Server instance uses each database's TRUSTWORTHY property to guard against tampering that could enable unwarranted privilege escalation. When TRUSTWORTHY is 0/False/Off, SQL Server prevents the database from accessing resources in other databases. When TRUSTWORTHY is 1/True/On, SQL Server permits access to other databases (subject to other protections). SQL Server sets TRUSTWORTHY OFF when it creates a new database. SQL Server forces TRUSTWORTHY OFF, irrespective of its prior value, when an existing database is attached to it, to address the possibility that an adversary may have tampered with the database, introducing malicious code. To set TRUSTWORTHY ON, an account with the [sysadmin] role must issue an ALTER DATABASE command.  Although SQL Server itself treats this property conservatively, application installer programs may set TRUSTWORTHY ON and leave it on. This provides an opportunity for misuse.  When TRUSTWORTHY is ON, users of the database can take advantage of the database owner's privileges, by impersonating the owner. This can have particularly serious consequences if the database owner is the [sa] login (which may have been renamed in accordance with SQL4-00-010200, and disabled in accordance with SQL4-00-017100, but nonetheless can be invoked in an EXECUTE AS USER = 'dbo' statement, or CREATE PROCEDURE ... WITH EXECUTE AS OWNER ...). The [sa] login cannot be removed from the [sysadmin] role. The user impersonating [sa] - or another [sysadmin] account - is then able to perform administrative actions across all databases under the instance, including making any himself or any other login a member of [sysadmin].  Most of the other fixed server roles could be similarly abused.  Therefore, TRUSTWORTHY must not be used on databases owned by logins that are members of the fixed server roles. Further, if TRUSTWORTHY is to be used for any other database, the need must be documented and approved.  The system database [msdb] is an exception: it is required to be TRUSTWORTHY."

Security labels are abstractions representing the basic properties or characteristics of an entity (e.g., subjects and objects) with respect to safeguarding information.

These labels are typically associated with internal data structures (e.g., tables, rows) within the database and are used to enable the implementation of access control and flow control policies, reflect special dissemination, handling or distribution instructions, or support other aspects of the information security policy.

One example includes marking data as classified or FOUO. These security labels may be assigned manually or during data processing, but, either way, it is imperative these assignments are maintained while the data is in storage. If the security labels are lost when the data is stored, there is the risk of a data compromise.

SQL Server does not include security labeling as a standard or licensable feature. Earlier releases of this STIG suggested using the SQL Server Label Security Toolkit, from codeplex.com. However, codeplex.com has been shut down, and it is unclear whether the Toolkit is still supported. If the organization does have access to the Toolkit, it may still be used, provided the organization accepts responsibility for its support. Other implementations may also exist. Custom application code is also a viable way to implement a solution.

  description : "SQL4-00-033700 - Time stamps in database tables must include both date and time of day, with a minimum granularity of one second."
  info        : "If time stamps are not consistently applied and there is no common time reference, it is difficult to perform forensic analysis, in audit files, trace files/tables, and application data tables.  Time stamps generated by SQL Server must include date and time, to a granularity of one second or finer. Time is commonly expressed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), a modern continuation of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), or local time with an offset from UTC. Granularity of time measurements refers to the precision available in time stamp values. Granularity coarser than one second is not sufficient for audit trail purposes, and granularity finer than one second is recommended. Time stamp values are typically presented with three or more decimal places of seconds; however, the actual granularity may be coarser than the apparent precision. For example, SQL Server's GETDATE()/CURRENT_TMESTAMP values are presented to three decimal places, but the granularity is not one millisecond: it is about 1/300 of a second.   The data types that can be used for this purpose in SQL Server are: DATETIME2 - precision variable from a whole second down to a ten-millionth (subject to the actual precision of the hardware and operating system) DATETIMEOFFSET - as datetime2, together with local offset from UTC DATE, together with TIME (same precision considerations as for datetime2) DATETIME - precision 1/300 of a second Character-string data types allowing for at least 20 characters are also permissible, but not recommended.  SQL Server built-in functions for retrieving current timestamps are:  (high precision) sysdatetime(), sysdatetimeoffset(), sysutcdatetime();  (lower precision) CURRENT_TIMESTAMP or getdate(), getutcdate().  Ensure that values recorded for tracking purposes in data tables are correctly defined and maintained.  (Design decisions about which tables require audit-trail or activity-tracking columns are outside the scope of this STIG.  This requirement applies only to the data type and maintenance of such columns if they do exist.)  The SMALLDATETIME data type is not precise enough for this purpose.  Although it gives the impression of including a seconds component, the seconds value is always '00'.  SQL Server offers a data type called TIMESTAMP that is not a representation of date and time. Rather, it is a database state counter and does not correspond to calendar and clock time. This requirement does not refer to that meaning of TIMESTAMP.  To avoid confusion, Microsoft recommends using the newer name for this data type, ROWVERSION, instead.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

For this or legacy reasons, the instance may be using SQL Server Trace for auditing, which remains an acceptable solution for the time being.  Note, however, that Microsoft intends to remove most aspects of Trace at some point after SQL Server 2016.  Use of SQL Server Audit's SCHEMA_OBJECT_ACCESS_GROUP causes capture of all accesses, successful and otherwise, to the system views (and all other schema-scoped objects).  The [Succeeded] column in the audit output indicates the success or failure of the attempted action.  Be aware, however, that it may report True in some cases where one would intuitively expect False.  For example, SELECT 1/0 FROM SYS.ALL_OBJECTS will appear in the audit trail as successful, if the user has permission to perform that action, even though it contains an invalid expression.  Some other actions that one would consider failures (such as selecting from a table that does not exist) may not appear at all."
      solution    : "Where SQL Server Trace is in use, define  and enable a trace that captures all auditable events.  The script provided in the supplemental file Trace.sql can be used to do this.
Add blocks of code to Trace.sql for each custom event class (integers in the range 82-91; the same event class may be used for all such triggers) used in these triggers.
Create triggers to raise a custom event on each locally-defined security table that requires tracking of Insert-Update-Delete operations.  The examples provided in the supplemental file CustomTraceEvents.sql can serve as the basis for these.
Execute Trace.sql.

For example, SELECT 1/0 FROM SYS.ALL_OBJECTS will appear in the audit trail as successful, if the user has permission to perform that action, even though it contains an invalid expression.

Add a block of code to the supplemental file Trace.sql for each custom event class (integers in the range 82-91; the same event class may be used for all such triggers) used in these triggers.
Ensure that Trace.sql includes blocks of code for event classes 42, 43, and 162.
Execute Trace.sql.
If SQL Server Audit is in use, design and deploy an Audit that captures all auditable events and data items.  The script provided in the supplemental file Audit.sql can be used as the basis for this.  Supplement the standard audit data as necessary, using Extended Events and/or triggers.

  info        : "This control is intended to address the confidentiality and integrity of information at rest in non-mobile devices and covers user information and system information. Information at rest refers to the state of information when it is located on a secondary storage device (e.g., disk drive, tape drive) within an organizational information system. Applications and application users generate information throughout the course of their application use.

User-generated data, as well as, application-specific configuration data, needs to be protected. Configurations and/or rule sets for firewalls, gateways, intrusion detection/prevention systems, filtering routers, and authenticator content are examples of system information likely requiring protection. Organizations may choose to employ different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity protections, as appropriate.

If the confidentiality and integrity of SQL Server data is not protected, the data will be open to compromise and unauthorized modification.

Protective measures include encryption, physical security of the facility where the storage devices reside, operating system file permissions, and organizational controls. Each of these should be applied as necessary and appropriate.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
  solution    : "Apply appropriate controls to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data on a secondary device.

Where encryption is required, this can be done by full-disk encryption or by database encryption. To enable database encryption, create a master key, create a database encryption key, and protect it by using mechanisms tied to the master key, and then set encryption on.

Implement physical security measures, operating system access control lists and organizational controls appropriate to the sensitivity level of the data in the database(s)."
