The value is treated as a strftime pattern, so %-escapes can be used to specify time-varying filenames. The supported %-escapes are similar to those listed in the Open Group's strftime specification. If you specify a filename without escapes, you should plan to use a log rotation utility to avoid eventually filling the partition that contains log_directory. If there are any time-zone-dependent %-escapes, the computation is done in the zone specified by log_timezone. Also, the system's strftime is not used directly, so platform-specific (nonstandard) extensions do not work.

If CSV-format output is enabled in log_destination, .csv will be appended to the log filename. (If log_filename ends in .log, the suffix is replaced instead.)

If log_filename is not set, then the value of log_directory is appended to an empty string and PostgreSQL will fail to start as it will try to write to a directory instead of a file."

The permissions should be set to allow only the necessary access to authorized personnel. In most cases the best setting is 0600, so that only the server owner can read or write the log files. The other commonly useful setting is 0640, allowing members of the owner's group to read the files, although to make use of that, you will need to alter the log_directory setting to store the log files outside the cluster data directory.

For example, using this setting in combination with a log_filename setting value like postgresql-%H.log would result in generating 24 hourly log files and then cyclically overwriting them:

postgresql-00.log

postgresql-01.log

[...]

Note: Truncation will occur only when a new file is being opened due to time-based rotation, not during server startup or size-based rotation (see later in this benchmark for size-based rotation details).

Rationale:

If this setting is disabled, pre-existing log files will be appended to if log_filename is configured in such a way that static names are generated.

Enabling or disabling the truncation should only be decided when also considering the value of log_filename and log_rotation_age/log_rotation_size. Some examples to illustrate the interaction between these settings:

% characters begin 'escape sequences' that are replaced with status information as outlined below. Unrecognized escapes are ignored. Other characters are copied straight to the log line. Some escapes are only recognized by session processes and will be treated as empty by background processes such as the main server process. Status information may be aligned either left or right by specifying a numeric literal after the % and before the option. A negative value will cause the status information to be padded on the right with spaces to give it a minimum width, whereas a positive value will pad on the left. Padding can be useful to aid human readability in log files.

Typically, regular users should only be granted the minimal set of privileges commensurate with managing the application:

DDL (create table, create view, create index, etc.)

Further, it has become best practice to create separate roles for DDL and DML. Given an application called 'payroll', one would create the following users:

payroll_owner

payroll_user

Any DDL privileges would be granted to the payroll_owner account only, while DML privileges would be given to the payroll_user account only. This prevents accidental creation/altering/dropping of database objects by application code that run as the payroll_user account.

By not restricting global administrative commands to superusers only, regular users granted excessive privileges may execute administrative commands with unintended and undesirable results.

With the publication of CVE-2018-1058, it is also recommended that all privileges be revoked from the public schema for all users on all databases:

postgres=# REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;
REVOKE

Default Value:

The table owner/creator has full privileges; all other users must be explicitly granted access.

Now you need to add entries to permission_target that correspond to your desired permissions.

Let's assume we have a schema appschema, and appuser should have SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, and INSERT permissions on all tables and views in that schema:

postgres=# INSERT INTO public.permission_target
postgres=#   (id, role_name, permissions,
postgres=#    object_type, schema_name)
postgres=# VALUES
postgres=#   (1, 'appuser', '{SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE}',
postgres=#    'TABLE', 'appschema');
INSERT 0 1

postgres=# INSERT INTO public.permission_target
postgres=#   (id, role_name, permissions,
postgres=#    object_type, schema_name)
postgres=# VALUES
postgres=#   (2, 'appuser', '{SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE}',
postgres=#    'VIEW', 'appschema');
INSERT 0 1

Of course, the user will need the USAGE privilege on the schema:

postgres=# INSERT INTO public.permission_target
postgres=#   (id, role_name, permissions,i
postgres=#    object_type, schema_name)
postgres=# VALUES
postgres=#   (3, 'appuser', '{USAGE}',
postgres=#    'SCHEMA', 'appschema');
INSERT 0 1

The user also needs USAGE privileges on the appseq sequence in that schema:

postgres=# INSERT INTO public.permission_target
postgres=#   (id, role_name, permissions,
postgres=#    object_type, schema_name, object_name)
postgres=# VALUES
postgres=#   (4, 'appuser', '{USAGE}',
postgres=#    'SEQUENCE', 'appschema', 'appseq');
INSERT 0 1

Now we can review which permissions are missing and which additional permissions are granted:

postgres=# SELECT * FROM public.permission_diffs();

 missing | role_name | object_type | schema_name | object_name | column_name | permission
---------+-----------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+------------
 f       | laurenz   | VIEW        | appschema   | appview     |             | SELECT
 t       | appuser   | TABLE       | appschema   | apptable    |             | DELETE
(2 rows)

That means that appuser is missing (missing is TRUE) the DELETE privilege on appschema.apptable which should be GRANTed, while user laurenz has the additional SELECT privilege on appschema.appview (missing is FALSE).

To review the actual permissions on an object, we can use the _permissions views:

postgres=# SELECT * FROM schema_permissions
postgres=#   WHERE role_name = 'appuser' AND schema_name = 'appschema' AND granted IS TRUE;

 object_type | role_name | schema_name | object_name | column_name | permissions | granted
-------------+-----------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+---------
 SCHEMA      | appuser   | appschema   |             |             | USAGE       | t
 (1 row)

    <report type:"WARNING">
      description : "4.6 Ensure Row Level Security (RLS) is configured correctly"
      info        : "In addition to the SQL-standard privilege system available through GRANT, tables can have row security policies that restrict, on a per-user basis, which individual rows can be returned by normal queries or inserted, updated, or deleted by data modification commands. This feature is also known as Row Level Security (RLS).

By default, tables do not have any policies, so if a user has access privileges to a table according to the SQL privilege system, all rows within it are equally available for querying or updating. Row security policies can be specific to commands, to roles, or to both. A policy can be specified to apply to ALL commands, or to any combination of SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE. Multiple roles can be assigned to a given policy, and normal role membership and inheritance rules apply.

If you use RLS and apply restrictive policies to certain users, it is important that the Bypass RLS privilege not be granted to any unauthorized users. This privilege overrides RLS-enabled tables and associated policies. Generally, only superusers and elevated users should possess this privilege.

Rationale:

If RLS policies and privileges are not configured correctly, users could perform actions on tables that they are not authorized to perform, such as inserting, updating, or deleting rows.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
      solution    : "Again, we are using the example from the PostgreSQL documentation using the example passwd table. We will create three database roles to illustrate the workings of RLS:

postgres=# CREATE ROLE admin;
CREATE ROLE
postgres=# CREATE ROLE bob;
CREATE ROLE
postgres=# CREATE ROLE alice;
CREATE ROLE

Now, we will insert known data into the passwd table:

postgres=# INSERT INTO passwd VALUES
  ('admin','xxx',0,0,'Admin','111-222-3333',null,'/root','/bin/dash');
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# INSERT INTO passwd VALUES
  ('bob','xxx',1,1,'Bob','123-456-7890',null,'/home/bob','/bin/zsh');
INSERT 0 1
postgres=# INSERT INTO passwd VALUES
  ('alice','xxx',2,1,'Alice','098-765-4321',null,'/home/alice','/bin/zsh');
INSERT 0 1

And we will enable RLS on the table:

postgres=# ALTER TABLE passwd ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE

Now that RLS is enabled, we need to define one or more policies. Create the administrator policy and allow it access to all rows:

postgres=# CREATE POLICY admin_all ON passwd TO admin USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);
CREATE POLICY

Create a policy for normal users to view all rows:

postgres=# CREATE POLICY all_view ON passwd FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY

Create a policy for normal users that allows them to update only their own rows and to limit what values can be set for their login shell:

postgres=# CREATE POLICY user_mod ON passwd FOR UPDATE
  USING (current_user = user_name)
  WITH CHECK (
    current_user = user_name AND
    shell IN ('/bin/bash','/bin/sh','/bin/dash','/bin/zsh','/bin/tcsh')
  );
CREATE POLICY

Grant all the normal rights on the table to the admin user:

postgres=# GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON passwd TO admin;
GRANT

Grant only select access on non-sensitive columns to everyone:

postgres=# GRANT SELECT
  (user_name, uid, gid, real_name, home_phone, extra_info, home_dir, shell)
  ON passwd TO public;
GRANT

Grant update to only the sensitive columns:

postgres=# GRANT UPDATE
  (pwhash, real_name, home_phone, extra_info, shell)
  ON passwd TO public;
GRANT

Ensure that no one has been granted Bypass RLS inadvertently, by running the psql display command \du+. If unauthorized users do have Bypass RLS granted then resolve this using the ALTER ROLE <user> NOBYPASSRLS; command.

You can now verify that 'admin', 'bob', and 'alice' are properly restricted by querying the passwd table as each of these roles.

Rationale:

Even when reducing and limiting the access to the superuser role as described earlier in this benchmark, it is still difficult to determine who accessed the superuser role and what actions were taken using that role.

Now that set_user is installed, we need to tell PostgreSQL to load its library:

$ whoami
root
$ vi ~postgres/12/data/postgresql.conf
$ load set_user libs before anything else
shared_preload_libraries = 'set_user, other_libs'
$ systemctl restart postgresql-12
$ systemctl status postgresql-12|grep 'ago$'
   Active: active (running) since [timestamp]; 1s ago

And now, we can install the extension with SQL:

postgres=# select * from pg_available_extensions where name = 'set_user';
  name   | default_version | installed_version |                  comment
---------+-----------------+-------------------+-----------------------------
set_user | 1.6             |                   | similar to SET ROLE but with
         |                 |                   | added logging
(1 row)

postgres=# create extension set_user;
CREATE EXTENSION
postgres=# select * from pg_available_extensions where name = 'set_user';
  name   | default_version | installed_version |                  comment
---------+-----------------+-------------------+-----------------------------
set_user | 1.6             | 1.6               | similar to SET ROLE but with
         |                 |                   | added logging

(1 row)

Now, we use GRANT to configure each DBA role to allow it to use the set_user functions. In the example below, we will configure my db user doug. (You would do this for each DBA's normal user role.)

postgres=# grant execute on function set_user(text) to doug;
GRANT
postgres=# grant execute on function set_user_u(text) to doug;
GRANT

Connect to PostgreSQL as yourself and verify it works as expected:

$ whoami
psql
$ psql -U doug -d postgres
postgres=> select set_user('postgres');
ERROR:  switching to superuser not allowed
HINT:  Use 'set_user_u' to escalate.
postgres=> select set_user_u('postgres');
 set_user_u
------------
 OK
(1 row)

postgres=# select current_user, session_user;
 current_user | session_user
--------------+--------------
 postgres     | doug
(1 row)

postgres=# select reset_user();
 reset_user
------------
 OK
(1 row)

postgres=> select current_user, session_user;
 current_user | session_user
--------------+--------------
 doug         | doug
(1 row)

Once all DBA's normal user accounts have been GRANTed permission, revoke the ability to login as the postgres (superuser) user:

postgres=# alter user postgres NOLOGIN;
ALTER ROLE

Which results in:

$ psql
psql: FATAL:  role 'postgres' is not permitted to log in
$ psql -U doug -d postgres
psql (11.3)

Make sure there are no other roles that are superuser's and can still login:

postgres=# SELECT rolname FROM pg_authid WHERE rolsuper and rolcanlogin;
 rolname
---------
(0 rows)

Verify there are no unprivileged roles that can login directly that are granted a superuser role even if it is multiple layers removed:

If any roles are identified by this query, use REVOKE to correct.

Impact:

Much like the venerable sudo does for the OS, set_user manages superuser access for PostgreSQL. Complete configuration of set_user is documented at the extension's website and should be reviewed to ensure the logging entries that your organization cares about are properly configured.

Note that some external tools assume they can connect as the postgres user by default and this is no longer true. You may find some tools need different options, reconfigured, or even abandoned to compensate for this.

A combination of any one or more of them executed at the right time under the right conditions has the potential to compromise the RDBMS. Mitigating risk is dependent upon one's understanding of the attack vectors and includes:

Via user session: includes those runtime parameters that can be set by a ROLE that persists for the life of a server-client session.

Via attribute: includes those runtime parameters that can be set by a ROLE during a server-client session that can be assigned as an attribute for an entity such as a table, index, database, or role.

Via server reload: includes those runtime parameters that can be set by the superuser using a SIGHUP or configuration file reload command and affects the entire cluster.

Via server restart: includes those runtime parameters that can be set and effected by restarting the server process and affects the entire cluster.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
      solution    : "In the case of a changed parameter, the value is returned back to its default value. In the case of a successful exploit of an already set runtime parameter then an analysis must be carried out determining the best approach mitigating the risk.

Impact:

It can be difficult to totally eliminate risk. Once changed, detecting a miscreant parameter can become problematic.

password_encryption =  scram-sha-256

Finally, restart PostgreSQL and confirm ssl using commands outlined in Audit Procedures:

postgres=# show ssl;

-----
 on
(1 row)

Impact:

A self-signed certificate can be used for testing, but a certificate signed by a certificate authority (CA) (either one of the global CAs or a local one) should be used in production so that clients can verify the server's identity. If all the database clients are local to the organization, using a local CA is recommended.

To ultimately enable and enforce ssl authentication for the server, appropriate hostssl records must be added to the pg_hba.conf file. Be sure to reload PostgreSQL after any changes (restart not required).

Note: The hostssl record matches connection attempts made using TCP/IP, but only when the connection is made with SSL encryption. The host record matches attempts made using TCP/IP, but allows both SSL and non-SSL connections. The hostnossl record matches attempts made using TCP/IP, but only those without SSL. Care should be taken to enforce SSL as appropriate.

      info        : "PostgreSQL must implement cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure or modification of organization-defined information at rest (to include, at a minimum, PII and classified information) on organization-defined information system components.

Rationale:

PostgreSQL handling data that requires 'data at rest' protections must employ cryptographic mechanisms to prevent unauthorized disclosure and modification of the information at rest. These cryptographic mechanisms may be native to PostgreSQL or implemented via additional software or operating system/file system settings, as appropriate to the situation. Information at rest refers to the state of information when it is located on a secondary storage device (e.g. disk drive, tape drive) within an organizational information system.

Selection of a cryptographic mechanism is based on the need to protect the integrity of organizational information. The strength of the mechanism is commensurate with the security category and/or classification of the information. Organizations have the flexibility to either encrypt all information on storage devices (i.e. full disk encryption) or encrypt specific data structures (e.g. files, records, or fields). Organizations may also optionally choose to implement both to implement layered security.

The decision whether, and what, to encrypt rests with the data owner and is also influenced by the physical measures taken to secure the equipment and media on which the information resides. Organizations may choose to employ different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity protections, as appropriate. If the confidentiality and integrity of application data is not protected, the data will be open to compromise and unauthorized modification.

The PostgreSQL pgcrypto extension provides cryptographic functions for PostgreSQL and is intended to address the confidentiality and integrity of user and system information at rest in non-mobile devices."
      solution    : "The pgcrypto extension is included with the PostgreSQL 'contrib' package. Although included, it needs to be created in the database.

As the database administrator, run the following:

postgres=# CREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto;
CREATE EXTENSION

Verify pgcrypto is installed:

postgres=# SELECT * FROM pg_available_extensions WHERE name='pgcrypto';
   name   | default_version | installed_version |         comment
----------+-----------------+-------------------+-------------------------
 pgcrypto | 1.3             | 1.3               | cryptographic functions
(1 row)

Impact:

When considering or undertaking any form of encryption, it is critical to understand the state of the encrypted data at all stages of the data lifecycle. The use of pgcrypto ensures that the data at rest in the tables (and therefore on disk) is encrypted, but for the data to be accessed by any users or applications, said users/applications will, by necessity, have access to the encrypt and decrypt keys and the data in question will be encrypted/decrypted in memory and then transferred to/from the user/application in that form.

As a matter of default policy, configuration files such as postgresql.conf, pg_hba.conf, and pg_ident, are placed in the data cluster's directory, $PGDATA. PostgreSQL can be configured to relocate these files to locations outside the data cluster which cannot then be accessed by an ordinary superuser login session.

Consideration should also be given to 'include directives'; these are cluster subdirectories where one can locate files containing additional configuration parameters. Include directives are meant to add more flexibility for unique installs or large network environments while maintaining order and consistent architectural design.

Rationale:

Leaving PostgreSQL configuration files within the data cluster's directory tree increases the changes that they will be inadvertently or intentionally altered.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
      solution    : "Follow these steps to remediate the configuration file locations and permissions:

Determine appropriate locations for relocatable configuration files based on your organization's security policies. If necessary, relocate and/or rename configuration files outside of the data cluster.

Ensure their file permissions are restricted as much as possible, i.e. only superuser read access.

Change the settings accordingly in the postgresql.conf configuration file.

Restart the database cluster for the changes to take effect.

      info        : "The PostgreSQL cluster is organized to carry out specific tasks in subdirectories. For the purposes of performance, reliability, and security these subdirectories should be relocated outside the data cluster.

Rationale:

Some subdirectories contain information, such as logs, which can be of value to others such as developers. Other subdirectories can gain a performance benefit when placed on fast storage devices. Finally, relocating a subdirectory to a separate and distinct partition mitigates denial of service and involuntary server shutdown when excessive writes fill the data cluster's partition, e.g. pg_xlog and pg_log.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
      solution    : "Perform the following steps to remediate the subdirectory locations and permissions:

Determine appropriate data, log, and tablespace directories and locations based on your organization's security policies. If necessary, relocate all listed directories outside the data cluster.

Ensure file permissions are restricted as much as possible, i.e. only superuser read access.

When directories are relocated to other partitions, ensure that they are of sufficient size to mitigate against excessive space utilization.

Lastly, change the settings accordingly in the postgresql.conf configuration file and restart the database cluster for changes to take effect.

Default Value:

The default for data_directory is ConfigDir and the default for log_directory is log (based on absolute path of data_directory). The defaults for tablespace settings are null, or not set, upon cluster creation.

      info        : "This recommendation covers non-regular, special files, and dynamic libraries.

PostgreSQL permits local logins via the UNIX DOMAIN SOCKET and, for the most part, anyone with a legitimate Unix login account can make the attempt. Limiting PostgreSQL login attempts can be made by relocating the UNIX DOMAIN SOCKET to a subdirectory with restricted permissions.

The creation and implementation of user-defined dynamic libraries is an extraordinary powerful capability. In the hands of an experienced DBA/programmer, it can significantly enhance the power and flexibility of the RDBMS. But new and unexpected behavior can also be assigned to the RDBMS, resulting in a very dangerous environment in what should otherwise be trusted.

Rationale:

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

Determine permissions based on your organization's security policies.

Relocate all files and ensure their permissions are restricted as much as possible, i.e. only superuser read access.

Ensure all directories where these files are located have restricted permissions such that the superuser can read but not write.

Lastly, change the settings accordingly in the postgresql.conf configuration file and restart the database cluster for changes to take effect.

Default Value:

The dynamic_library_path default is $libdir and unix_socket_directories default is /var/run/postgresql, /tmp. The default for external_pid_file and all library parameters are initially null, or not set, upon cluster creation.
