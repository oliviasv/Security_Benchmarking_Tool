      info        : "If audit data were to become compromised, competent forensic analysis and discovery of the true source of potentially malicious system activity would be impossible to achieve.

To ensure the veracity of audit data, the information system and/or the application must protect audit information from unauthorized deletion. This requirement can be achieved through multiple methods, which will depend upon system architecture and design.

Some commonly employed methods include ensuring log files enjoy the proper file system permissions utilizing file system protections, restricting access, and backing up log data to ensure log data is retained.

Applications providing a user interface to audit data will leverage user permissions and roles identifying the user accessing the data and the corresponding rights the user enjoys in order to make decisions regarding the deletion of audit data.

Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system activity.

Deletion of database audit data could mask the theft or unauthorized modification of sensitive data stored in the database."

These automatically-generated accounts are referred to as virtual accounts.  Each virtual account has an equivalent Service SID, with the same name.  The installer also creates an equivalent SQL Server login, also with the same name.  Applying folder and file permissions to Service SIDs, rather than to domain accounts or local computer accounts, provides tighter control, because these permissions are available only to the specific service when it is running, and not in any other context.  (However, when using failover clustering, a domain account must be specified at installation, rather than a virtual account.)

Note 1: It is highly advisable to use a separate account for each service. When installing SQL Server in single-server mode, you can opt to have these provisioned for you. These automatically generated accounts are referred to as virtual accounts. Each virtual account has an equivalent Service SID, with the same name. The installer also creates an equivalent SQL Server login, also with the same name. Applying folder and file permissions to Service SIDs, rather than to domain accounts or local computer accounts, provides tighter control because these permissions are available only to the specific service when it is running and not in any other context. (However, when using failover clustering, a domain account must be specified at installation, rather than a virtual account.) For more on this topic, see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms143504(v=sql.110).aspx.

Note 2: Tips for adding a service SID/virtual account to a folder's permission list.
1) In Windows Explorer, right-click on the folder and select 'Properties.'

4) Click 'Add'
5) Click 'Locations'
6) Select the computer name
7) Search for the name

7.a.i) Type 'NT SERVICE\MSSQL' and click 'Check Names'. (What you have just typed in is the first 16 characters of the name. At least one character must follow 'NT SERVICE\'; you will be presented with a list of all matches. If you have typed in the full, correct name, step 7.a.ii is bypassed.)

Note 1: It is highly advisable to use a separate account for each service. When installing SQL Server in single-server mode, you can opt to have these provisioned for you. These automatically-generated accounts are referred to as virtual accounts. Each virtual account has an equivalent Service SID, with the same name. The installer also creates an equivalent SQL Server login, also with the same name. Applying folder and file permissions to Service SIDs, rather than to domain accounts or local computer accounts, provides tighter control because these permissions are available only to the specific service when it is running and not in any other context. (However, when using failover clustering, a domain account must be specified at installation, rather than a virtual account.) For more on this topic, see http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms143504(v=sql.110).aspx.

      description : "SQL2-00-039100 - The SQL Server Browser service must be disabled if its use is not necessary."
      info        : "The SQL Server Browser simplifies the administration of SQL Server, particularly when multiple instances of SQL Server coexist on the same computer.  It avoids the need to hard-assign port numbers to the instances and to set and maintain those port numbers in client systems.  It enables administrators and authorized users to discover database management system instances, and the databases they support, over the network.

This convenience also presents the possibility of unauthorized individuals gaining knowledge of the available SQL Server resources.  Therefore, it is necessary to consider whether the SQL Server Browser is needed.  Typically, if only a single instance is installed, using the default name (MSSQLSERVER) and port assignment (1433), the Browser is not adding any value.   The more complex the installation, the more likely SQL Server Browser is to be helpful.

This requirement is not intended to prohibit use of the Browser service in any circumstances; rather, it calls for administrators and management to consider whether the benefits of its use outweigh the potential negative consequences.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
      solution    : "If SQL Server Browser is needed, document the justification and obtain the appropriate approvals.

Where SQL Server Browser is judged unnecessary, in the Services tool, double-click on 'SQL Server Browser' to open its 'Properties' dialog.  Set Startup Type to 'Disabled'.  If Service Status is 'Running', click on 'Stop'.  Click on 'OK'."
