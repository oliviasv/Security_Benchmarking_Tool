In addition to these protections, auditing must also be utilized in order to track system activity, assist in diagnosing system issues, and provide evidence needed for forensic investigations after a security incident.

          info        : "Once an attacker establishes initial access to a system, they often attempt to create a persistent method of re-establishing access. One way to accomplish this is for the attacker to simply modify an existing account.

    Auditing of account modification is one method and best practice for mitigating this risk. A comprehensive application account management process ensures an audit trail automatically documents the modification of application user accounts and, as required, notifies administrators, application owners, and/or appropriate individuals. Applications must provide this capability directly, leveraging complementary technology providing this capability or a combination thereof.

    Automated account auditing processes greatly reduces the risk that accounts will be surreptitiously modified and provides logging that can be used for forensic purposes.

    Note that user authentication and account management should be done via an enterprise-wide mechanism whenever possible.  Examples of enterprise-level authentication/access mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Active Directory and LDAP.

Examples of particular actions taken by individuals include creating information, sending a message, approving information (e.g., indicating concurrence or signing a contract), and receiving a message.

  Non-repudiation protects individuals against later claims by an author of not having authored a particular document, a sender of not having transmitted a message, a receiver of not having received a message, or a signatory of not having signed a document.

  Authentication via shared accounts does not provide individual accountability for actions taken on the DBMS or data. Whenever a single database account is used to connect to the database, a secondary authentication method that provides individual accountability is required. This scenario most frequently occurs when an externally hosted application authenticates individual users to the application and the application uses a single account to retrieve or update database information on behalf of the individual users.

  When shared accounts are utilized without another means of identifying individual users, users may deny having performed a particular action.

  This calls for inspection of application source code, which will require collaboration with the application developers. It is recognized that in many cases, the database administrator (DBA) is organizationally separate from the application developers and may have limited, if any, access to source code. Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored. At a minimum, the DBA must attempt to obtain assurances from the development organization that this issue has been addressed and must document what has been discovered."

Neither of these internetworking mechanisms is private or secure and they do not by default restrict access to networked resources once connectivity is established.

    Numerous best practices are employed to protect remote connections, such as utilizing encryption to protect data sessions and firewalls to restrict and control network connectivity. In addition to these protections, auditing must also be utilized in order to track system activity, assist in diagnosing system issues, and provide evidence needed for forensic investigations after a security incident.

    When organizations define security-related application functions or security-related application information, it is incumbent upon the application providing access to that data to ensure auditing of remote connectivity to those resources occurs in support of organizational requirements

    Remote access to security functions (e.g., user management, audit log management, etc.) and security-relevant information requires the activity be audited by the organization. Any application providing remote access must support organizational requirements to audit access or organization-defined security functions and security-relevant information.

    Database security features accessed through remote methods must be audited to ensure the access is authorized and appropriate."
          solution    : "Configure the DBMS's auditing to audit organization-defined auditable events. If preferred, use a third-party tool. The tool must provide the minimum capability to audit the required events.

    If using a third-party product, proceed in accordance with the product documentation. If using Oracle's capabilities, proceed as follows.

    Use this process to ensure auditable events are captured:

Examples include, but are not limited to, using automation to take action on multiple accounts designated as inactive, suspended, or terminated, or by disabling accounts located in non-centralized account stores, such as multiple servers.

Enterprise environments make application user account management challenging and complex.  A user management process requiring administrators to manually address account management functions adds risk of potential oversight.

Automated mechanisms may be comprised of differing technologies that when placed together contain an overall automated mechanism supporting an organization's automated account management requirements.

Databases can have large numbers of users in disparate locations and job functions.  Automatic account management can help mitigate the risk of human error found in manually managing database access.

Note that user authentication and account management must be done via an enterprise-wide mechanism whenever possible.

Roles and Profiles are two Oracle features that should be employed in account management. (Indeed, other requirements mandate the use of Roles.) Following are some notes from Oracle on the use of Profiles.

A profile is a named set of resource limits and password parameters that restrict database usage and instance resources for a user. You can assign a profile to each user, and a default profile to all others. Each user can have only one profile, and creating a new one supersedes any earlier one.

Profile resource limits are enforced only when you enable resource limitation for the associated database. Enabling such limitation can occur either before starting up the database (the RESOURCE_LIMIT initialization parameter) or while it is open (using an ALTER SYSTEM statement).

While password parameters reside in profiles, they are unaffected by RESOURCE_LIMIT or ALTER SYSTEM and password management is always enabled."

To address this, in the event temporary application accounts are required, the application must ensure accounts designated as temporary in nature shall automatically terminate these accounts after an organization-defined time period.

Set values in the profile as needed for temporary users - see below for further information. The values here are examples; set them to values appropriate to the situation:

CREATE PROFILE TEMPORARY_USERS

PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME UNLIMITED
PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME 3;
CREATE USER <username> IDENTIFIED BY <password> PROFILE TEMPORARY_USERS;

Resource Parameters:

COMPOSITE_LIMIT - Specify the total resource cost for a session, expressed in service units. Oracle Database calculates the total service units as a weighted sum of CPU_PER_SESSION, CONNECT_TIME,
LOGICAL_READS_PER_SESSION, and PRIVATE_SGA.

SESSIONS_PER_USER - Specify the number of concurrent sessions to limit the user to.

CPU_PER_SESSION - Specify the CPU time limit for a session, expressed in hundredths of seconds.

CPU_PER_CALL - Specify the CPU time limit for a call (a parse, execute, or fetch), expressed in hundredths of seconds.

LOGICAL_READS_PER_SESSION - Specify the permitted number of data blocks read in a session, including blocks read from memory and disk.

LOGICAL_READS_PER_CALL - Specify the permitted number of data blocks read for a call to process a SQL statement (a parse, execute, or fetch).

PRIVATE_SGA - Specify the amount of private space a session can allocate in the shared pool of the system global area (SGA). Refer to size_clause for information on that clause.

CONNECT_TIME - Specify the total elapsed time limit for a session, expressed in minutes.

IDLE_TIME - Specify the permitted periods of continuous inactive time during a session, expressed in minutes. Long-running queries and other operations are not subject to this limit.

COMPOSITE_LIMIT - See Oracle documentation for more details.


Password Parameters

Use the following clauses to set password parameters. Parameters that set lengths of time are interpreted in number of days. For testing purposes, specify minutes (n/1440) or even seconds (n/86400).

FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS - Specify the number of failed attempts to log on to the user account before the account is locked. If omitting this clause, then the default is 10 times.

PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME - Specify the number of days the same password can be used for authentication. If setting a value for PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME, then the password expires if it is not changed within the grace period, and further connections are rejected. If omitting this clause, then the default is 180 days.

PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME and PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX - These two parameters must be set in conjunction with each other. PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME specifies the number of days before which a password cannot be reused. PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX specifies the number of password changes required before the current password can be reused. For these parameters to have any effect, specify an integer for both of them.

If specifying a value for both of these parameters, then the user cannot reuse a password until the password has been changed the number of times specified for PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX during the number of days specified for PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME.

For example, if specifying PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME to 30 and PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX to 10, then the user can reuse the password after 30 days if the password has already been changed 10 times.

If specifying a value for either of these parameters and specify UNLIMITED for the other, then the user can never reuse a password.

If specifying DEFAULT for either parameter, then Oracle Database uses the value defined in the DEFAULT profile. By default, all parameters are set to UNLIMITED in the DEFAULT profile. If the default setting of UNLIMITED in the DEFAULT profile has not changed, then the database treats the value for that parameter as UNLIMITED.

If setting both of these parameters to UNLIMITED, then the database ignores both of them. This is the default if omitting both parameters.

PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME - Specify the number of days an account will be locked after the specified number of consecutive failed logon attempts. If omitting this clause, then the default is 1 day.

PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME - Specify the number of days after the grace period begins during which a warning is issued and logon is allowed. If omitting this clause, then the default is 7 days.

PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION - The PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION clause lets a PL/SQL password complexity verification script be passed as an argument to the CREATE PROFILE statement. Oracle Database provides a default script, but can create your own routine or use third-party software instead."

FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS - Specify the number of failed attempts to log on to the user account before the account is locked. If omitting this clause, then the default is 10 times.

PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME - Specify the number of days the same password can be used for authentication. If setting a value for PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME, then the password expires if it is not changed within the grace period, and further connections are rejected. If omitting this clause, then the default is 180 days.

PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME and PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX - These two parameters must be set in conjunction with each other. PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME specifies the number of days before which a password cannot be reused. PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX specifies the number of password changes required before the current password can be reused. For these parameters to have any effect, specify an integer for both of them.

If specifying a value for both of these parameters, then the user cannot reuse a password until the password has been changed the number of times specified for PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX during the number of days specified for PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME.

For example, if specifying PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME to 30 and PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX to 10, then the user can reuse the password after 30 days if the password has already been changed 10 times.

If specifying a value for either of these parameters and specify UNLIMITED for the other, then the user can never reuse a password.

If specifying DEFAULT for either parameter, then Oracle Database uses the value defined in the DEFAULT profile. By default, all parameters are set to UNLIMITED in the DEFAULT profile.

DAC is a type of access control methodology serving as a means of restricting access to objects and data based on the identity of subjects and/or groups to which they belong. It is discretionary in the sense that application users with the appropriate permissions to access an application resource or data have the discretion to pass that permission on to another user either directly or indirectly.

Data protection requirements may result in a DAC policy being specified as part of the application design. Discretionary access controls would be employed at the application level to restrict and control access to application objects and data thereby providing increased information security for the organization.

When DAC controls are employed, those controls must limit sharing to named application users, groups of users, or both. The application DAC controls must also limit the propagation of access rights and have the ability to exclude access to data down to the granularity of a single user.

Databases using DAC must have the ability for the owner of an object or information to assign or revoke rights to view or modify the object or information.  If the owner of an object or information does not have rights to exclude access to an object or information at a user level, users may gain access to objects and information they are not authorized to view/modify.

This is generally accomplished by removing records generated by specified classes of events, such as records generated by nightly backups.

An audit reduction capability provides support for near real-time audit review and analysis based on policy requirements regarding what must be audited on the system and after-the-fact investigations of security incidents. It is important to recognize audit reduction does not alter original audit records.

Audit reduction and reporting tools do not alter original audit records.

To leverage the complete capability of audit reduction, the application must possess the ability to specify and automatically process certain event criteria that are selectable in nature. In other words, a system administrator (SA) may be performing a manual review of audit data to identify a particular problem. The SA has determined that backup activity and network connections from a particular host comprise the bulk of the events. However, these events are not related to the activity being investigated. The application must be able to automatically process these audit records for audit reduction purposes rather than making the administrator manually process them.

The lack of audit reduction and reporting in a database can require the DBA, or others responsible for reviewing audit logs, to sort through large amounts of data in order to find relevant records. This can cause important audit records to be missed.

Oracle offers the choice of storing audit data internally in database tables, or in external files.  The WHERE clause in the SELECT statement provides the necessary functionality for a table-based audit.  For an audit based on external files (or for a table-based audit trail archived to external files) Oracle Database does not provide tools for retrieving and managing the data once written.

If Standard Auditing is used:
Revoke access to the AUD$ table to anyone who should not have access to it.

In the check we looked for all users who had access to the AUD$ table. To fix this, use the REVOKE command to revoke access to users who should not have access to the audit data.

REVOKE statement

Use the REVOKE statement to remove permissions from a specific user or from all users to perform actions on database objects.
The following types of permissions can be revoked:

    Delete data from a specific table.
    Insert data into a specific table.
    Create a foreign key reference to the named table or to a subset of columns from a table.
    Select data from a table, view, or a subset of columns in a table.
    Create a trigger on a table.
    Update data in a table or in a subset of columns in a table.
    Run a specified routine (function or procedure).

If a user named FRED had access to the AUD$ table and wanting to revoke that access, use the following command. The syntax that would be used for the REVOKE statement for tables is as follows:

REVOKE privilege-type ON [ TABLE ] { table-Name | view-Name } FROM grantees

SQL>REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE AUD$ FROM FRED;

Revoking a privilege without specifying a column list revokes the privilege for all of the columns in the table.
Syntax for routines

table-privileges include

  DELETE |

Use the ALL PRIVILEGES privilege type to revoke all of the permissions from the user for the specified table. Can also revoke one or more table privileges by specifying a privilege-list.

Use the DELETE privilege type to revoke permission to delete rows from the specified table.

Use the INSERT privilege type to revoke permission to insert rows into the specified table.

Use the REFERENCES privilege type to revoke permission to create a foreign key reference to the specified table. If a column list is specified with the REFERENCES privilege, the permission is revoked on only the foreign key reference to the specified columns.

Use the SELECT privilege type to revoke permission to perform SELECT statements on a table or view. If a column list is specified with the SELECT privilege, the permission is revoked on only those columns. If no column list is specified, then the privilege is valid on all of the columns in the table.

Use the TRIGGER privilege type to revoke permission to create a trigger on the specified table.

Use the UPDATE privilege type to revoke permission to use the UPDATE statement on the specified table. If a column list is specified, the permission is revoked only on the specified columns.

  { authorization ID | PUBLIC } [,{ authorization ID | PUBLIC } ] *

Can revoke the privileges from specific users or from all users. Use the keyword PUBLIC to specify all users. The privileges revoked from PUBLIC and from individual users are independent privileges. For example, a SELECT privilege on table t is granted to both PUBLIC and to the authorization ID harry. The SELECT privilege is later revoked from the authorization ID 'Harry', but the authorization ID 'Harry' can access the table through the PUBLIC privilege.

Restriction: Cannot revoke the privileges of the owner of an object.

Cascading object dependencies

For views, triggers, and constraints, if the privilege on which the object depends is revoked, the object is automatically dropped. Derby does not try to determine if there are other privileges that can replace the privileges that are being revoked. For more information, see 'SQL standard authorization' in the Java DB Developer's Guide.
Limitations

The following limitations apply to the REVOKE statement:

Table-level privileges:

All of the table-level privilege types for a specified grantee and table ID are stored in one row in the SYSTABLEPERMS system table. For example, when user2 is granted the SELECT and DELETE privileges on table user1.t1, a row is added to the SYSTABLEPERMS table. The GRANTEE field contains user2 and the TABLEID contains user1.t1. The SELECTPRIV and DELETEPRIV fields are set to Y. The remaining privilege type fields are set to N.

When a grantee creates an object that relies on one of the privilege types, the Derby engine tracks the dependency of the object on the specific row in the SYSTABLEPERMS table. For example, user2 creates the view v1 by using the statement SELECT * FROM user1.t1; the dependency manager tracks the dependency of view v1 on the row in SYSTABLEPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1). The dependency manager knows only that the view is dependent on a privilege type in that specific row but does not track exactly which privilege type the view is dependent on.

When a REVOKE statement for a table-level privilege is issued for a grantee and table ID, all of the objects that are dependent on the grantee and table ID are dropped. For example, if user1 revokes the DELETE privilege on table t1 from user2, the row in SYSTABLEPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1) is modified by the REVOKE statement. The dependency manager sends a revoke invalidation message to the view user2.v1, and the view is dropped, even though the view is not dependent on the DELETE privilege for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1).

Column-level privileges:

Only one type of privilege for a specified grantee and table ID are stored in one row in the SYSCOLPERMS system table. For example, when user2 is granted the SELECT privilege on table user1.t1 for columns c12 and c13, a row is added to the SYSCOLPERMS. The GRANTEE field contains user2, the TABLEID contains user1.t1, the TYPE field contains S, and the COLUMNS field contains c12, c13.

When a grantee creates an object that relies on the privilege type and the subset of columns in a table ID, the Derby engine tracks the dependency of the object on the specific row in the SYSCOLPERMS table. For example, user2 creates the view v1 by using the statement SELECT c11 FROM user1.t1; the dependency manager tracks the dependency of view v1 on the row in SYSCOLPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S). The dependency manager knows that the view is dependent on the SELECT privilege type but does not track exactly which columns the view is dependent on.

When a REVOKE statement for a column-level privilege is issued for a grantee, table ID, and type, all of the objects that are dependent on the grantee, table ID, and type are dropped. For example, if user1 revokes the SELECT privilege on column c12 on table user1.t1 from user2, the row in SYSCOLPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S) is modified by the REVOKE statement. The dependency manager sends a revoke invalidation message to the view user2.v1, and the view is dropped, even though the view is not dependent on the column c12 for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S).

If Standard Auditing is used:
Revoke access to the AUD$ table to anyone who should not have access to it.

In the check we looked for all users who had access to the AUD$ table. To fix this, use the REVOKE command to revoke access to users who should not have access to the audit data.

REVOKE statement

Use the REVOKE statement to remove permissions from a specific user or from all users to perform actions on database objects.
The following types of permissions can be revoked:

    Delete data from a specific table.
    Insert data into a specific table.
    Create a foreign key reference to the named table or to a subset of columns from a table.
    Select data from a table, view, or a subset of columns in a table.
    Create a trigger on a table.
    Update data in a table or in a subset of columns in a table.
    Run a specified routine (function or procedure).

If a user named FRED had access to the AUD$ table and wanting to revoke that access, use the following command. The syntax that would be used for the REVOKE statement for tables is as follows:

REVOKE privilege-type ON [ TABLE ] { table-Name | view-Name } FROM grantees

SQL>REVOKE SELECT ON TABLE AUD$ FROM FRED;

Revoking a privilege without specifying a column list revokes the privilege for all of the columns in the table.

For example, when user2 is granted the SELECT and DELETE privileges on table user1.t1, a row is added to the SYSTABLEPERMS table. The GRANTEE field contains user2 and the TABLEID contains user1.t1. The SELECTPRIV and DELETEPRIV fields are set to Y. The remaining privilege type fields are set to N.

When a grantee creates an object that relies on one of the privilege types, the Derby engine tracks the dependency of the object on the specific row in the SYSTABLEPERMS table. For example, user2 creates the view v1 by using the statement SELECT * FROM user1.t1; the dependency manager tracks the dependency of view v1 on the row in SYSTABLEPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1). The dependency manager knows only that the view is dependent on a privilege type in that specific row but does not track exactly which privilege type the view is dependent on.

When a REVOKE statement for a table-level privilege is issued for a grantee and table ID, all of the objects that are dependent on the grantee and table ID are dropped. For example, if user1 revokes the DELETE privilege on table t1 from user2, the row in SYSTABLEPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1) is modified by the REVOKE statement. The dependency manager sends a revoke invalidation message to the view user2.v1, and the view is dropped, even though the view is not dependent on the DELETE privilege for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1).

Column-level privileges:

Only one type of privilege for a specified grantee and table ID are stored in one row in the SYSCOLPERMS system table. For example, when user2 is granted the SELECT privilege on table user1.t1 for columns c12 and c13, a row is added to the SYSCOLPERMS. The GRANTEE field contains user2, the TABLEID contains user1.t1, the TYPE field contains S, and the COLUMNS field contains c12, c13.

When a grantee creates an object that relies on the privilege type and the subset of columns in a table ID, the Derby engine tracks the dependency of the object on the specific row in the SYSCOLPERMS table.

Limitations

The following limitations apply to the REVOKE statement:

Table-level privileges:

All of the table-level privilege types for a specified grantee and table ID are stored in one row in the SYSTABLEPERMS system table. For example, when user2 is granted the SELECT and DELETE privileges on table user1.t1, a row is added to the SYSTABLEPERMS table. The GRANTEE field contains user2 and the TABLEID contains user1.t1. The SELECTPRIV and DELETEPRIV fields are set to Y. The remaining privilege type fields are set to N.

When a grantee creates an object that relies on one of the privilege types, the Derby engine tracks the dependency of the object on the specific row in the SYSTABLEPERMS table. For example, user2 creates the view v1 by using the statement SELECT * FROM user1.t1; the dependency manager tracks the dependency of view v1 on the row in SYSTABLEPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1). The dependency manager knows only that the view is dependent on a privilege type in that specific row but does not track exactly which privilege type the view is dependent on.

When a REVOKE statement for a table-level privilege is issued for a grantee and table ID, all of the objects that are dependent on the grantee and table ID are dropped. For example, if user1 revokes the DELETE privilege on table t1 from user2, the row in SYSTABLEPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1) is modified by the REVOKE statement. The dependency manager sends a revoke invalidation message to the view user2.v1, and the view is dropped, even though the view is not dependent on the DELETE privilege for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1).

Column-level privileges:

Only one type of privilege for a specified grantee and table ID are stored in one row in the SYSCOLPERMS system table. For example, when user2 is granted the SELECT privilege on table user1.t1 for columns c12 and c13, a row is added to the SYSCOLPERMS. The GRANTEE field contains user2, the TABLEID contains user1.t1, the TYPE field contains S, and the COLUMNS field contains c12, c13.

When a grantee creates an object that relies on the privilege type and the subset of columns in a table ID, the Derby engine tracks the dependency of the object on the specific row in the SYSCOLPERMS table. For example, user2 creates the view v1 by using the statement SELECT c11 FROM user1.t1; the dependency manager tracks the dependency of view v1 on the row in SYSCOLPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S). The dependency manager knows that the view is dependent on the SELECT privilege type but does not track exactly which columns the view is dependent on.

When a REVOKE statement for a column-level privilege is issued for a grantee, table ID, and type, all of the objects that are dependent on the grantee, table ID, and type are dropped. For example, if user1 revokes the SELECT privilege on column c12 on table user1.t1 from user2, the row in SYSCOLPERMS for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S) is modified by the REVOKE statement. The dependency manager sends a revoke invalidation message to the view user2.v1, and the view is dropped, even though the view is not dependent on the column c12 for GRANTEE(user2), TABLEID(user1.t1), TYPE(S).

Finally, when upgrading, the AUD$ table and LOBs will need to be moved back to the SYSTEM tablespace or the upgrade will fail.

Check to ensure that the ENCRYPTION_WALLET_LOCATION (or WALLET_LOCATION) parameter in the sqlnet.ora file points to the correct software wallet location. (Note: This assumes that a single sqlnet.ora file, in the default location, is in use. Please see the supplemental file 'Non-default sqlnet.ora configurations.pdf' for how to find multiple and/or differently located sqlnet.ora files.) For example:

ENCRYPTION_WALLET_LOCATION=
(SOURCE=(METHOD=FILE)(METHOD_DATA=
(DIRECTORY=/app/wallet)))

If the ENCRYPTION_WALLET_LOCATION parameter is not set, then it attempts to use the keystore in the location that is specified by the parameter WALLET_LOCATION.

If the WALLET_LOCATION parameter is also not set, then Oracle Database looks for a keystore at the default database location, which is ORACLE_BASE/admin/DB_UNIQUE_NAME/wallet or ORACLE_HOME/admin/DB_UNIQUE_NAME/wallet. (DB_UNIQUE_NAME is the unique name of the database specified in the initialization parameter file.) When the keystore location is not set in the sqlnet.ora file, then the V$ENCRYPTION_WALLET view displays the default location. Can check the location and status of the keystore in the V$ENCRYPTION_WALLET view.

Oracle Database 12c Release 1 (12.1) uses the same master encryption key for both TDE column encryption and TDE tablespace encryption. When issuing the ALTER SYSTEM SET ENCRYPTION KEY command, a unified master encryption key is created for both TDE column encryption and TDE tablespace encryption.

Resetting the Tablespace Master Encryption Key

Oracle Database 12c Release 1 (12.1) uses a unified master encryption key for both TDE column encryption and TDE tablespace encryption. When resetting (rekeying) the master encryption key for TDE column encryption, the master encryption key for TDE tablespace encryption also gets reset. The ALTER SYSTEM SET ENCRYPTION KEY command resets the tablespace master encryption key. Before creating an encrypted tablespace, the Oracle wallet containing the tablespace master encryption key must be open. The wallet must also be open before accessing data in an encrypted tablespace. The security administrator needs to open the Oracle wallet after starting the Oracle instance. A restart of the Oracle instance requires the security administrator to open the wallet again. The security administrator also needs to open the wallet before performing database recovery operations. This is because background processes may require access to encrypted redo and undo logs. When performing database recovery, the wallet must be opened before opening the database. This is illustrated in the following statements:

SQL> STARTUP MOUNT;
SQL> ALTER SYSTEM SET ENCRYPTION WALLET OPEN IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
SQL> ALTER DATABASE OPEN;

Can also choose to use auto logon wallets if the environment does not require the extra security provided by a wallet that needs to be explicitly opened; however, this is not the recommended practice.

Creating the wallet/keystore

SQL> ADMINISTER KEY MANAGEMENT CREATE KEYSTORE '/app/wallet' IDENTIFIED BY password;

keystore altered.

Set the TDE Master Encryption Key in the Software Keystore

SQL> ADMINISTER KEY MANAGEMENT SET KEY IDENTIFIED BY password WITH BACKUP USING 'backup_identifier';

keystore altered.

Creating an Encrypted Tablespace

The CREATE TABLESPACE command enables the creation of an encrypted tablespace. The permanent_tablespace_clause enables choosing the encryption algorithm and the key length for encryption. The ENCRYPT keyword in the storage_clause encrypts the tablespace. The following syntax illustrates this:

CREATE
[ BIGFILE | SMALLFILE ]
{ permanent_tablespace_clause
| temporary_tablespace_clause
| undo_tablespace_clause
} ;

Where, permanent_tablespace_clause=TABLESPACE , ENCRYPTION [USING algorithm] storage_clause
Where, storage_clause=[ENCRYPT] where:

The encryption algorithm can have one of the following values:

3DES168
AES128
AES192
AES256

The key lengths are included in the names of the algorithms themselves. If no encryption algorithm is specified, the default encryption algorithm is used. The default encryption algorithm is AES128.

Note: The ENCRYPTION keyword in the permanent_tablespace_clause is used to specify the encryption algorithm. The ENCRYPT keyword in the storage_clause actually encrypts the tablespace. For security reasons, a tablespace cannot be encrypted with the NO SALT option.

Commands to create Encrypted Tablespace

CREATE TABLESPACE securespace
DATAFILE '/home/user/oradata/secure01.dbf'
SIZE 150M
ENCRYPTION USING '3DES168'
DEFAULT STORAGE(ENCRYPT);

This creates a tablespace called securespace2 using an algorithm of 3DES168.

Cannot encrypt an existing tablespace. However, can import data into an encrypted tablespace using the Oracle Data Pump utility. Can also use SQL commands like CREATE TABLE...AS SELECT...or ALTER TABLE...MOVE... to move data into an encrypted tablespace. The CREATE TABLE...AS SELECT... command enables the creation of a table from an existing table. The ALTER TABLE...MOVE... command enables the move of a table into the encrypted tablespace.

Then we move the sys.aud$ from system tablespace to securespace tablespace.

Notes on Oracle Backup and Recovery Solutions

When implementing a backup and recovery strategy, have the following solutions available:

--  Recovery Manager (RMAN)
Recovery Manager is fully integrated with the Oracle database to perform a range of backup and recovery activities, including maintaining an RMAN repository of historical data about backups. Can access RMAN through the command line or through Oracle Enterprise Manager.

--  User-managed backup and recovery
In this solution, perform backup and recovery with a mixture of host operating system commands and SQL*Plus recovery commands. Responsible for determining all aspects of when and how backups and recovery are done.

--  Media management
If not wanting to use RMAN with an encrypted backup, consider configuring RMAN to make backups to a media manager.  On most platforms, to back up to and restore from sequential media such as tape, must integrate a media manager with the Oracle database. Can use Oracle Secure Backup, which supports both database and file system backups to tape, as the media manager. See Oracle Secure Backup Administrator's Guide to learn how to set up RMAN for use specifically with Oracle Secure Backup.

These solutions are supported by Oracle and are fully documented, but RMAN is the preferred solution for database backup and recovery. RMAN provides a common interface for backup tasks across different host operating systems and offers several backup techniques not available through user-managed methods.

--  Incremental backups:
An incremental backup stores only blocks changed since a previous backup.  Thus, they provide more compact backups and faster recovery, thereby reducing the need to apply redo during data file media recovery. If enabling block change tracking, then can improve performance by avoiding full scans of every input data file. Can use the BACKUP INCREMENTAL command to perform incremental backups.

--  Block media recovery:
Can repair a data file with only a small number of corrupt data blocks without taking it off-line or restoring it from backup. Can use the RECOVER BLOCK command to perform block media recovery.

--  Binary compression:
A binary compression mechanism integrated into Oracle Database reduces the size of backups.

--  Encrypted backups:
RMAN uses backup encryption capabilities integrated into Oracle Database to store backup sets in an encrypted format. To create encrypted backups on disk, the database must use the Advanced Security Option. To create encrypted backups directly on tape, RMAN must use the Oracle Secure Backup SBT interface but does not require the Advanced Security Option.

--  Automated database duplication:
Easily creates a copy of the database, supporting various storage configurations, including direct duplication between ASM databases.

--  Cross-platform data conversion:
Whether using RMAN or user-managed methods, can supplement physical backups with logical backups of schema objects made with Data Pump Export utility. Can later use Data Pump Import to re-create data after restore and recovery.  Logical backups are mostly beyond the scope of the backup and recovery documentation."

A shared authenticator is a generic account used by multiple individuals. Use of a shared authenticator alone does not uniquely identify individual users. An example of a shared authenticator is the UNIX OS 'root' user account, a Windows 'administrator' account, an 'SA' account, or a 'helpdesk' account.

For example, the UNIX and Windows operating systems offer a 'switch user' capability allowing users to authenticate with their individual credentials and, when needed, 'switch' to the administrator role. This method provides for unique individual authentication prior to using a shared authenticator.

Some applications may not have the need to provide a group authenticator; this is considered a matter of application design. In those instances where the application design includes the use of a shared authenticator, this requirement will apply.

There may also be instances when specific user actions need to be performed on the information system without unique user identification or authentication. An example of this type of access is a web server which contains publicly releasable information. These types of accesses are allowed but must be explicitly identified and documented by the organization.

When shared accounts are utilized without another means of identifying individual users, users may deny having performed a particular action.

When there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted becomes the trust anchor; it can be for example a Certification Authority (CA). A certification path starts with the Subject certificate and proceeds through a number of intermediate certificates up to a trusted root certificate, typically issued by a trusted CA.

Path validation is necessary for a relying party to make an informed trust decision when presented with any certificate not already explicitly trusted.

- - - - -

To configure specific session termination processes, we need to define the organization or policy-defined session termination event. Below are some examples.

Oracle has several ways to disconnect idle sessions, both from within SQL*Plus via resources profiles (connect_time, idle_time) and with the SQL*net expire time parameter.

Can use profiles to set the connect time and idle time with 'alter profile' statements:

alter profile senior_claim_analyst limit
connect_time 15
sessions_per_user 2
ldle_time 10;

Profiles comprise a named set of resource limits. By default, when users are created, they are given the default profile, which provides unlimited use of all resources.

The syntax to create a profile follows:

CREATE PROFILE LIMIT resource_parameters|password_parameters;
Resource_parameters:
[SESSIONS_PER_USER n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]
[CPU_PER_SESSION n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]
[CPU_PER_CALL n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]
[CONNECT_TIME n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]
[IDLE_TIME n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]

By setting resource limits, can prevent users from performing operations that will tie up the system and prevent other users from performing operations. Can use resource limits for security, to ensure that users log off the system, so as not to leave the session connected for long periods of time.

The system resource limits can be enforced at the session level, the call level, or both. The session level is calculated from the time the user logs on to the database until the user exits. The call level applies to each SQL command issued. Session-level limits are enforced for each connection. When a session-level limit is exceeded, only the last SQL command issued is rolled back; no further work can be performed until a commit, rollback, or exit is performed.

Using SQLNET.EXPIRE_TIME

The sqlnet.expire_time parameter is used to set a time interval, in minutes, to determine how often a probe should be sent verifying that client/server connections are active. If there is a need to ensure that connections are not left open indefinitely (or up to the time set by operating system-specific parameters), set a value that is greater than 0. This protects the system from connections left open due to an abnormal client termination.

When the probe detects a terminated connection or a connection no longer in use, it signals an error, causing the server process to exit. This setting is intended for use on the database server side of the connection, which usually handles multiple connections at any one time. Limitations on using this terminated (dead) connection detection feature are:

sqlnet.expire_time cannot be used on bequeathed connections.

The SQL*Net expire_time probe packet will generate additional network traffic that may downgrade the network's performance, depending on the number of connections.

Depending on the operating system that is in use, additional server processing may need to be performed to distinguish the connection probe from other events that occur. This overhead for detection of probe events can result in downgraded network performance.

Turning-on expire_time

To set up these advanced features, simply edit the sqlnet.ora file. If a beginner, follow this procedure:

Start the Oracle Network Manager GUI.

In the GUI navigator pane, expand the icons Local >> Profile.

From the list on the right-hand pane, select General.

Click on the Advanced tab.

Next, enter the values for the fields or options to set.

When finished, choose File >> Save Network Configuration to write the changes to the sqlnet.ora file. (Note: This assumes that a single sqlnet.ora file, in the default location, is in use. Please see the supplemental file 'Non-default sqlnet.ora configurations.pdf' for how to find multiple and/or differently located sqlnet.ora files.)

The sqlnet.ora inbound_connect_timeout parameter is used to limit the time, set in seconds, for a client to connect with the database server and provide the required authentication information.

CREATE PROFILE LIMIT resource_parameters|password_parameters;
Resource_parameters:
[SESSIONS_PER_USER n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]
[CPU_PER_SESSION n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]
[CPU_PER_CALL n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]
[CONNECT_TIME n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]
[IDLE_TIME n|UNLIMITED|DEFAULT]

By setting resource limits, can prevent users from performing operations that will tie up the system and prevent other users from performing operations. Can use resource limits for security, to ensure that users log off the system, so as not to leave the session connected for long periods of time.

The system resource limits can be enforced at the session level, the call level, or both. The session level is calculated from the time the user logs on to the database until the user exits. The call level applies to each SQL command issued. Session-level limits are enforced for each connection. When a session-level limit is exceeded, only the last SQL command issued is rolled back; no further work can be performed until a commit, rollback, or exit is performed.

Using SQLNET.EXPIRE_TIME

The sqlnet.expire_time parameter is used to set a time interval, in minutes, to determine how often a probe should be sent verifying that client/server connections are active. If there is a need to ensure that connections are not left open indefinitely (or up to the time set by operating system-specific parameters), set a value that is greater than 0. This protects the system from connections left open due to an abnormal client termination.

When the probe detects a terminated connection or a connection no longer in use, it signals an error, causing the server process to exit. This setting is intended for use on the database server side of the connection, which usually handles multiple connections at any one time. Limitations on using this terminated (dead) connection detection feature are:

sqlnet.expire_time cannot be used on bequeathed connections.

The SQL*Net expire_time probe packet will generate additional network traffic that may downgrade the network's performance, depending on the number of connections.

Depending on the operating system that is in use, additional server processing may need to be performed to distinguish the connection probe from other events that occur. This overhead for detection of probe events can result in downgraded network performance.

Turning-on expire_time

To set up these advanced features, simply edit the sqlnet.ora file. If a beginner, follow this procedure:

Start the Oracle Network Manager GUI.

In the GUI navigator pane, expand the icons Local >> Profile.

From the list on the right-hand pane, select General.

Click on the Advanced tab.

Next, enter the values for the fields or options to set.

When finished, choose File >> Save Network Configuration to write the changes to the sqlnet.ora file. (Note: This assumes that a single sqlnet.ora file, in the default location, is in use. Please see the supplemental file 'Non-default sqlnet.ora configurations.pdf' for how to find multiple and/or differently located sqlnet.ora files.)

The sqlnet.ora inbound_connect_timeout parameter

The sqlnet.ora inbound_connect_timeout parameter is used to limit the time, set in seconds, for a client to connect with the database server and provide the required authentication information.

Also see sqlnet.inbound_connect_timeout tips.

To limit consumption of Oracle resources by unauthorized users and enable an audit trail, should set time-limit values for the sqlnet.inbound_connect_timeout parameter in wall-clock seconds. (This parameter does not have default values.) Failure resulting from sqlnet.inbound_connect_timeout will throw an ORA-03136 inbound connection timed out error."

(This limit applies only when using shared server architecture. The private space for a session in the SGA includes private SQL and PL/SQL areas, but not shared SQL and PL/SQL areas.) Specify the total resource cost for a session, expressed in service units. Oracle Database calculates the total service units as a weighted sum of CPU_PER_SESSION, CONNECT_TIME, LOGICAL_READS_PER_SESSION, and PRIVATE_SGA.

To limit exposure when operating from within a privileged account or role, the application must support organizational requirements that users of information system accounts, or roles, with access to organization-defined lists of security functions or security-relevant information, use non-privileged accounts, or roles, when accessing other (non-security) system functions.

Use of privileged accounts for non-administrative purposes puts data at risk of unintended or unauthorized loss, modification, or exposure. In particular, DBA accounts if used for non-administration application development or application maintenance can lead to miss-assignment of privileges where privileges are inherited by object owners. It may also lead to loss or compromise of application data where the elevated privileges bypass controls designed in and provided by applications.

The DBMS software installation account may require privileges not required for database administration or other functions. Use of accounts configured with excess privileges may result in the loss or compromise of data or system settings due to elevated privileges that bypass controls designed to protect them.

This requirement is particularly important because Oracle equates the installation account with the SYS account - the super-DBA.

Audit record content that may be necessary to satisfy the requirement of this control includes but is not limited:  timestamps, source and destination IP addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, application specific events, success/fail indications, file names involved, access control or flow control rules invoked.

Centralized management of audit records and logs provides for efficiency in maintenance and management of records, as well as, the backup and archiving of those records. When organizations define application components requiring centralized audit log management, applications need to support that requirement.

Database audit records not stored in a centralized audit log management tool may be overlooked during investigation of a security incident or may be subject to intentional or accidental manipulation by privileged users of the database.

If the application were to allow any user to make changes to software libraries, then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the appropriate testing and approvals that are part of a robust change management process.

This requirement is contingent upon the language in which the application is programmed, as many application architectures in use today incorporate their software libraries into, and make them inseparable from, their compiled distributions, rendering them static and version-dependent. However, this requirement does apply to applications with software libraries accessible and configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages.

Accordingly, only qualified and authorized individuals shall be allowed to obtain access to information system components for purposes of initiating changes, including upgrades and modifications.

DBA and other privileged administrative or application owner accounts are granted privileges that allow actions that can have a greater impact on database security and operation. It is especially important to grant access to privileged accounts to only those persons who are qualified and authorized to use them.

This requirement is particularly important because Oracle equates the installation account with the SYS account - the super-DBA.  Once logged on to the operating system, this account can connect to the database AS SYSDBA without further authentication.

      info        : "In support of Audit Review, Analysis, and Reporting requirements, audit reduction is a technique used to reduce the volume of audit records in order to facilitate a manual review.

Before a security review is conducted, information systems and/or applications with an audit reduction capability may remove many audit records known to have little security significance. This is generally accomplished by removing records generated by specified classes of events, such as records generated by nightly backups.

In order to identify and report on what (repetitive) data has been removed via the use of audit reduction, the application must provide a capability to generate reports containing what values were removed by the audit reduction.

Audit reduction does not alter original audit records. An audit reduction capability provides support for near real-time audit review and analysis based on policy-based requirements and after-the-fact investigations of security incidents.

Reporting tools employing audit reduction methods must not alter the original audit data. An example of a tool employing audit reduction methods is the Windows Event Viewer tool which is used to view and analyze audit logs on Windows systems.

The lack of reporting tools for audit reduction can require the DBA, or others responsible for reviewing audit logs, to sort through large amounts of data in order to find relevant records.  This can cause important audit records to be missed.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

To that extent, a variety of technologies exist to limit, or in some cases, eliminate the effects of DoS attacks.

For example, boundary protection devices can filter certain types of packets to protect devices from being directly affected by  DoS attacks. Limiting system resources that are allocated to any user to a bare minimum may also reduce the ability of users to launch some DoS attacks.

Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored. At a minimum, the DBA must attempt to obtain assurances from the development organization that this issue has been addressed and must document what has been discovered."
      solution    : "Configure DBMS settings to restrict functionality that could be used to initiate DoS attacks.

Securing the Network Connection:
Protecting the network and its traffic from inappropriate access or modification is the essence of network security. You should consider all paths the data travels, and assess the threats on each path and node. Then, take steps to lessen or eliminate those threats and the consequences of a security breach. In addition, monitor and audit to detect either increased threat levels or penetration attempts.

The following practices improve network security:

1. Disable the Default Listener.
All listeners have a unique name instead of the name LISTENER and have startup protection.

LISTENER=(DESCRIPTION =(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST=)(PORT = 0)))

This configuration prevents the default listener from starting.

2. Prevent online administration by requiring the administrator to have the write privilege on the listener.ora file on the server.
a. Add or alter this line in the listener.ora file:

ADMIN_RESTRICTIONS_LISTENER=ON

b. Use RELOAD to reload the configuration.

3. Set Protection against crafted network packets on database level.

SEC_PROTOCOL_ERROR_TRACE_ACTION specifies the action that the database should take when bad packets are received from a possibly malicious client.

SEC_PROTOCOL_ERROR_TRACE_ACTION = { NONE | TRACE | LOG | ALERT } (TRACE is the default)

NONE: The database server ignores the bad packets and does not generate any trace files or log messages. (Not recommended)

TRACE: A detailed trace file is generated when bad packets are received, which can be used to debug any problems in client/server communication.

LOG: A minimal log message is printed in the alert logfile and in the server trace file. A minimal amount of disk space is used.

ALERT: An alert message is sent to a DBA or monitoring console.

SEC_PROTOCOL_ERROR_FURTHER_ACTION specifies the further execution of a server process when receiving bad packets from a possibly malicious client.

SEC_PROTOCOL_ERROR_FURTHER_ACTION = { CONTINUE | (DELAY,integer) | (DROP,integer) } (DROP,3 is the default)

CONTINUE: The server process continues execution. The database server may be subject to a Denial of Service (DoS) if bad packets continue to be sent by a malicious client. (Not recommended)

(DELAY, integer) :The client experiences a delay of integer seconds before the server process accepts the next request from the same client connection. Malicious clients are prevented from excessive consumption of server resources while legitimate clients experience degradation in performance but can continue to function.

(DROP, integer) : The server forcefully terminates the client connection after integer bad packets. The server protects itself at the expense of the client (for example, a client transaction may be lost). The client may reconnect and attempt the same operation.

SEC_MAX_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS specifies the number of authentication attempts that can be made by a client on a connection to the server process. After the specified number of failure attempts, the connection will be automatically dropped by the server process.

SEC_MAX_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS = n (3 is the default) Values range from 1 to unlimited. (A value of 1 to 3 is recommended)

For more information about the parameters in listener.ora, see https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/NETRF/listener.htm#NETRF008

4. When a host computer has multiple IP addresses associated with multiple network interface controller (NIC) cards, configure the listener to the specific IP address.

You can restrict the listener to listen on a specific IP address. Oracle recommends that you specify the specific IP addresses on these types of computers, rather than allowing the listener to listen on all IP addresses. Restricting the listener to specific IP addresses helps to prevent an intruder from stealing a TCP end point from under the listener process.

5. Restrict the privileges of the listener, so that it cannot read or write files in the database or the Oracle server address space.

The default configuration for external procedures does not require a network listener to work with Oracle Database and the extproc agent. The extproc agent is spawned directly by Oracle Database and eliminates the risks that the extproc agent might be spawned by Oracle Listener unexpectedly. This default configuration is recommended for maximum security. For more information about securing external procedures see
https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/DBSEG/app_devs.htm#DBSEG656
However, the extproc agent can be configured to be spawned by a listener. In that case (not recommended) the listener should have restricted privileges.

6. Use a firewall, IAW DoD network policy and guidance.

Appropriately placed and configured firewalls can prevent outside access to your databases.

7. Prevent unauthorized administration of the Oracle listener.

Local administration of the listener is secure by default through the local operating system. Therefore configuring a password is neither required nor recommended for secure local administration. However, a password can be configured for the listener to provide security for administrative operations, such as starting or stopping the listener, viewing a list of supported services, or saving changes to the Listener Control configuration.

By default, Oracle Net Listener permits only local administration for security reasons. As a policy, the listener can be administered only by the user who started it. This is enforced through local operating system authentication. For example, if user1 starts the listener, then only user1 can administer it. Any other user trying to administer the listener gets an error. The super user is the only exception.

Oracle recommends that you perform listener administration in the default mode (secure by means of local operating system authentication), and access the system remotely using a remote logon. Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control can also be used for remote administration.

8. Encrypt network traffic.  (Mandatory for sensitive data and optional for non-sensitive, as covered in other STIG requirements.)

Where applicable, use Oracle network data encryption to encrypt network traffic among clients, databases, and application servers.

9. Set Connect Rate to organization defined limit. (Also required by O121-C2-019100/SRG-APP-000245-DB-000132)

The connection rate limiter feature in Oracle Net Listener enables a database administrator to limit the number of new connections handled by the listener. When this feature is enabled, Oracle Net Listener imposes a user-specified maximum limit on the number of new connections handled by the listener every second.

CONNECTION_RATE_LISTENER=10
LISTENER=
(ADDRESS_LIST=
(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcp)(HOST=)(PORT=1521)(RATE_LIMIT=yes))
(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcp)(HOST=)(PORT=1522)(RATE_LIMIT=yes))
(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcp)(HOST=)(PORT=1526))
)

10. Setup Valid Node Checking.
(See also O121-BP-025600.)

Valid node checking is a security feature that protects DBMS instances from malevolent or errant Oracle Net connections over TCP/IP, without the need for a firewall or IP address filtering at the operating system-level. The feature is controlled by the three parameters; tcp.validnode_checking, tcp.invited_nodes, and tcp.excluded_nodes.

Modify the sqlnet.ora file manually
TCP.VALIDNODE_CHECKING=yes
(Note: This assumes that a single sqlnet.ora file, in the default location, is in use. Please see the supplemental file 'Non-default sqlnet.ora configurations.pdf' for how to find multiple and/or differently located sqlnet.ora files.)

If this parameter is set to yes, then incoming connections are allowed only if they originate from a node that conforms to the list specified by TCP.INVITED_NODES or TCP.EXCLUDED_NODES parameters.

The TCP.INVITED_NODES and TCP.EXCLUDED_NODES parameters are valid only when the TCP.VALIDNODE_CHECKING parameter is set to yes (no is the default).

Modify the listener.ora file manually

TCP.EXCLUDED_NODES Syntax:
TCP.EXCLUDED_NODES=(hostname | ip_address, hostname | ip_address, ...)

Example:
TCP.EXCLUDED_NODES=(finance.us.example.com, mktg.us.example.com, 192.0.2.25, 172.30.*, 2001:DB8:200C:417A/32)

TCP.INVITED_NODES Syntax:
TCP.INVITED_NODES=(hostname | ip_address, hostname | ip_address, ...)

Example:
TCP.INVITED_NODES=(sales.us.example.com, hr.us.example.com, 192.0.*, 2001:DB8:200C:433B/32)

Usage Notes:

Use TCP.INVITED_NODES to specify which clients are allowed access to the database. This list takes precedence over the TCP.EXCLUDED_NODES parameter if both lists are present. These parameters can use wildcards for IPv4 addresses and CIDR notation for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

11. Apply Listener Security Patches.
(See also O121-C1-011100/SRG-APP-000133-DB-000205.)

Critical Patch Updates are cumulative. Therefore, the latest patch will contain all previous security patches for the Listener.

12. Ensure that listener logging is turned on.

Listener logging is on by default. If logging is not on, configure logging for all listeners in order to capture Listener commands and brute force password attacks.

13. Monitor the listener logfile.

The logfile may contain TNS-01169, TNS-01189, TNS-01190, or TNS-12508 errors, which may signify attacks or inappropriate activity. Monitor the logfile and generate an alert whenever these errors are encountered."

Nevertheless, protections of this type are so important to the secure operation of databases that they must not be ignored. At a minimum, the DBA must attempt to obtain assurances from the development organization that this issue has been addressed and must document what has been discovered."

Securing the Network Connection:
Protecting the network and its traffic from inappropriate access or modification is the essence of network security. You should consider all paths the data travels, and assess the threats on each path and node. Then, take steps to lessen or eliminate those threats and the consequences of a security breach. In addition, monitor and audit to detect either increased threat levels or penetration attempts.

The following practices improve network security:

1. Disable the Default Listener.
All listeners have a unique name instead of the name LISTENER and have startup protection.

LISTENER=(DESCRIPTION =(ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST=)(PORT = 0)))

This configuration prevents the default listener from starting.

2. Prevent online administration by requiring the administrator to have the write privilege on the listener.ora file on the server.
a. Add or alter this line in the listener.ora file:

ADMIN_RESTRICTIONS_LISTENER=ON

b. Use RELOAD to reload the configuration.

3. Set Protection against crafted network packets on database level.

SEC_PROTOCOL_ERROR_TRACE_ACTION specifies the action that the database should take when bad packets are received from a possibly malicious client.

SEC_PROTOCOL_ERROR_TRACE_ACTION = { NONE | TRACE | LOG | ALERT } (TRACE is the default)

NONE: The database server ignores the bad packets and does not generate any trace files or log messages. (Not recommended)

TRACE: A detailed trace file is generated when bad packets are received, which can be used to debug any problems in client/server communication.

LOG: A minimal log message is printed in the alert logfile and in the server trace file. A minimal amount of disk space is used.

ALERT: An alert message is sent to a DBA or monitoring console.

SEC_PROTOCOL_ERROR_FURTHER_ACTION specifies the further execution of a server process when receiving bad packets from a possibly malicious client.

SEC_PROTOCOL_ERROR_FURTHER_ACTION = { CONTINUE | (DELAY,integer) | (DROP,integer) } (DROP,3 is the default)

CONTINUE: The server process continues execution. The database server may be subject to a Denial of Service (DoS) if bad packets continue to be sent by a malicious client. (Not recommended)

(DELAY, integer) :The client experiences a delay of integer seconds before the server process accepts the next request from the same client connection. Malicious clients are prevented from excessive consumption of server resources while legitimate clients experience degradation in performance but can continue to function.

(DROP, integer) : The server forcefully terminates the client connection after integer bad packets. The server protects itself at the expense of the client (for example, a client transaction may be lost). The client may reconnect and attempt the same operation.

SEC_MAX_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS specifies the number of authentication attempts that can be made by a client on a connection to the server process. After the specified number of failure attempts, the connection will be automatically dropped by the server process.

SEC_MAX_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS = n (3 is the default) Values range from 1 to unlimited. (A value of 1 to 3 is recommended)

For more information about the parameters in listener.ora, see https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/NETRF/listener.htm#NETRF008

4. When a host computer has multiple IP addresses associated with multiple network interface controller (NIC) cards, configure the listener to the specific IP address.

You can restrict the listener to listen on a specific IP address. Oracle recommends that you specify the specific IP addresses on these types of computers, rather than allowing the listener to listen on all IP addresses. Restricting the listener to specific IP addresses helps to prevent an intruder from stealing a TCP end point from under the listener process.

5. Restrict the privileges of the listener, so that it cannot read or write files in the database or the Oracle server address space.

The default configuration for external procedures does not require a network listener to work with Oracle Database and the extproc agent. The extproc agent is spawned directly by Oracle Database and eliminates the risks that the extproc agent might be spawned by Oracle Listener unexpectedly. This default configuration is recommended for maximum security. For more information about securing external procedures see
https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/DBSEG/app_devs.htm#DBSEG656
However, the extproc agent can be configured to be spawned by a listener. In that case (not recommended) the listener should have restricted privileges.

6. Use a firewall, IAW DoD network policy and guidance.

Appropriately placed and configured firewalls can prevent outside access to your databases.

7. Prevent unauthorized administration of the Oracle listener.

Local administration of the listener is secure by default through the local operating system. Therefore configuring a password is neither required nor recommended for secure local administration. However, a password can be configured for the listener to provide security for administrative operations, such as starting or stopping the listener, viewing a list of supported services, or saving changes to the Listener Control configuration.

By default, Oracle Net Listener permits only local administration for security reasons. As a policy, the listener can be administered only by the user who started it. This is enforced through local operating system authentication. For example, if user1 starts the listener, then only user1 can administer it. Any other user trying to administer the listener gets an error. The super user is the only exception.

Oracle recommends that you perform listener administration in the default mode (secure by means of local operating system authentication), and access the system remotely using a remote logon. Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control can also be used for remote administration.

8. Encrypt network traffic.  (Mandatory for sensitive data and optional for non-sensitive, as covered in other STIG requirements.)

Where applicable, use Oracle network data encryption to encrypt network traffic among clients, databases, and application servers.

9. Set Connect Rate to organization defined limit. (Also required by O121-C2-019100/SRG-APP-000245-DB-000132)

The connection rate limiter feature in Oracle Net Listener enables a database administrator to limit the number of new connections handled by the listener. When this feature is enabled, Oracle Net Listener imposes a user-specified maximum limit on the number of new connections handled by the listener every second.

CONNECTION_RATE_LISTENER=10
LISTENER=
(ADDRESS_LIST=
(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcp)(HOST=)(PORT=1521)(RATE_LIMIT=yes))
(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcp)(HOST=)(PORT=1522)(RATE_LIMIT=yes))
(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcp)(HOST=)(PORT=1526))
)

10. Setup Valid Node Checking.
(See also O121-BP-025600.)

Valid node checking is a security feature that protects DBMS instances from malevolent or errant Oracle Net connections over TCP/IP, without the need for a firewall or IP address filtering at the operating system-level. The feature is controlled by the three parameters; tcp.validnode_checking, tcp.invited_nodes, and tcp.excluded_nodes.

Modify the sqlnet.ora file manually
TCP.VALIDNODE_CHECKING=yes
(Note: This assumes that a single sqlnet.ora file, in the default location, is in use. Please see the supplemental file 'Non-default sqlnet.ora configurations.pdf' for how to find multiple and/or differently located sqlnet.ora files.)

If this parameter is set to yes, then incoming connections are allowed only if they originate from a node that conforms to the list specified by TCP.INVITED_NODES or TCP.EXCLUDED_NODES parameters.

The TCP.INVITED_NODES and TCP.EXCLUDED_NODES parameters are valid only when the TCP.VALIDNODE_CHECKING parameter is set to yes (no is the default).

Modify the listener.ora file manually

TCP.EXCLUDED_NODES Syntax:
TCP.EXCLUDED_NODES=(hostname | ip_address, hostname | ip_address, ...)

Example:
TCP.EXCLUDED_NODES=(finance.us.example.com, mktg.us.example.com, 192.0.2.25, 172.30.*, 2001:DB8:200C:417A/32)

TCP.INVITED_NODES Syntax:
TCP.INVITED_NODES=(hostname | ip_address, hostname | ip_address, ...)

Example:
TCP.INVITED_NODES=(sales.us.example.com, hr.us.example.com, 192.0.*, 2001:DB8:200C:433B/32)

Usage Notes:

Use TCP.INVITED_NODES to specify which clients are allowed access to the database. This list takes precedence over the TCP.EXCLUDED_NODES parameter if both lists are present. These parameters can use wildcards for IPv4 addresses and CIDR notation for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

11. Apply Listener Security Patches.
(See also O121-C1-011100/SRG-APP-000133-DB-000205.)

Critical Patch Updates are cumulative. Therefore, the latest patch will contain all previous security patches for the Listener.

12. Ensure that listener logging is turned on.

Listener logging is on by default. If logging is not on, configure logging for all listeners in order to capture Listener commands and brute force password attacks.

13. Monitor the listener logfile.

The logfile may contain TNS-01169, TNS-01189, TNS-01190, or TNS-12508 errors, which may signify attacks or inappropriate activity. Monitor the logfile and generate an alert whenever these errors are encountered."
