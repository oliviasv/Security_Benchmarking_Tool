  description : "NET-NAC-031 - The switch must only allow a maximum of one registered MAC address per access port."
  info        : "The switch must only allow a maximum of one registered MAC address per access port.

Limiting the number of registered MAC addresses on a switch access port can help prevent a CAM table overflow attack.  This type of attack lets an attacker exploit the hardware and memory limitations of a switch.  If there are enough entries stored in a CAM table before the expiration of other entries, no new entries can be accepted into the CAM table. An attacker will able to flood the switch with mostly invalid MAC addresses until the CAM table's resources have been depleted.  When there are no more resources, the switch has no choice but to flood all ports within the VLAN with all incoming traffic.  This happens because the switch cannot find the switch port number for a corresponding MAC address within the CAM table, allowing the switch to become a hub and traffic to be monitored.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance.

Review the switch configuration to verify each access port is configured for a single registered MAC address.

Configuring port-security on the Cisco switch access port interface will automatically set the maximum number of registered MAC addresses to one.  The value will not show up in the configuration of the switch itself.  To validate the access port has a maximum value of one for allowable MAC addresses, you must run the following command:

Switch# show port-security interface

Show Command Example:
Switch# port int fa0/1
Port Security                :Enabled
Port Status                  :Secure-down
Violation Mode               :Shutdown
Aging Time                   :0 mins
Aging Type                   :Absolute
SecureStatic Address Aging   :Disabled
Maximum MAC Addresses        :1

Some technologies are exempt from requiring a single MAC address per access port; however, restrictions still apply.  VoIP or VTC endpoints may provide a PC port so a PC can be connected.  Each of the devices will need to be statically assigned to each access port.

Another green initiative where a single LAN drop is shared among several devices is called 'hot-desking', which is related to conservation of office space and teleworking. Hot-desking is where several people are assigned to work at the same desk at different times, each user with their own PC.  In this case, a different MAC address needs to be permitted for each PC that is connecting to the LAN drop in the workspace. Additionally, this workspace could contain a single phone (and possibly desktop VTC endpoint) used by all assignees and the PC port on it might be the connection for their laptop.  In this case, it is best not to use sticky port security, but to use a static mapping of authorized devices or implement 802.1x. If this is not a teleworking remote location, this exemption does not apply."

VLAN hopping can be initiated by an attacker who has access to a switch port belonging to the same VLAN as the native VLAN of the trunk link connecting to another switch in which the victim is connected to. If the attacker knows the victim's MAC address, it can forge a frame with two 802.1q tags and a layer 2 header with the destination address of the victim. Since the frame will ingress the switch from a port belonging to its native VLAN, the trunk port connecting to victim's switch will simply remove the outer tag because native VLAN traffic is to be untagged.

Idle TCP sessions can be susceptible to unauthorized access and hijacking attacks. By default, routers do not continually test whether a previously connected TCP endpoint is still reachable. If one end of a TCP connection idles out or terminates abnormally, the opposite end of the connection may still believe the session is available. These 'orphaned' sessions use up valuable router resources and can also be hijacked by an attacker. To mitigate this risk, routers must be configured to send periodic keepalive messages to check that the remote end of a session is still connected.

To launch an attack on the NTP infrastructure, a hacker could inject time that would be accepted by NTP clients by spoofing the IP address of a valid NTP server. To mitigate this risk, the time messages must be authenticated by the client before accepting them as a time source.

Two NTP-enabled devices can communicate in either client-server mode or peer-to-peer mode (aka \"symmetric mode\"). The peering mode is configured manually on the device and indicated in the outgoing NTP packets. The fundamental difference is the synchronization behavior: an NTP server can synchronize to a peer with better stratum, whereas it will never synchronize to its client regardless of the client's stratum. From a protocol perspective, NTP clients are no different from the NTP servers. The NTP client can synchronize to multiple NTP servers, select the best server and synchronize with it, or synchronize to the averaged value returned by the servers.

A hierarchical model can be used to improve scalability. With this implementation, an NTP client can also become an NTP server providing time to downstream clients at a higher stratum level and of decreasing accuracy than that of its upstream server. To increase availability, NTP peering can be used between NTP servers. In the event the device loses connectivity to its upstream NTP server, it will be able to choose time from one of its peers.

The NTP authentication model is opposite of the typical client-server authentication model.

The management interface can be a true OOBM interface or a standard interface functioning as the management interface. In either case, the management interface of the managed network element will be directly connected to the OOBM network.

Since all management traffic is immediately forwarded into the management network, it is not exposed to possible tampering.  The separation also ensures that congestion or failures in the managed network do not affect the management of the device. If the device does not have an OOBM port, the interface functioning as the management interface must be configured so that management traffic does not leak into the managed network and that production traffic does not leak into the management network. ISL and 802.1q trunking enables multiple VLANs to traverse the same physical links between layer 2 switches or between a layer 2 switch and a router. If the management VLAN is not pruned from any VLAN trunk links belonging to the managed network's infrastructure, management traffic has the potential to leak into the production network.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance.

The management VLAN must be pruned from any VLAN trunk links belonging to the managed network's infrastructure.  By default all the VLANs that exist on a switch are active on a trunk link. Since the switch is being managed via OOBM connection, management traffic should not traverse any trunk links. The following Catalyst IOS configuration is an example of a trunk link with the management VLAN (i.e. 10) pruned from a trunk.

interface fastEthernet0/1
 switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
 switchport mode dynamic desirable
 switchport trunk native vlan 3
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 2-9

This can also be verified with the show interface trunk command as shown below:

Switch-A# show interface trunk
Port      Mode         Encapsulation  Status        Native vlan
Fa0/1     desirable    802.1q         trunking      3
Port      Vlans allowed on trunk
Fa0/1     2-9
Port      Vlans in spanning tree forwarding state and not pruned
Fa0/1     2-5

NOTE: VTP pruning allows the switch to not forward user traffic for VLANs that are not active on a remote switch. This feature dynamically prunes unneeded traffic across trunk links.  VTP pruning needs to be enabled on the server for the VTP domains-after which all VTP clients in the VTP domain will automatically enable VTP pruning. To enable VTP pruning on a Cisco IOS switch, you use the vtp pruning VLAN configuration or global configuration command. Since, the management VLAN will be active on all managed switchs, VTP will never prune this VLAN. Hence, it will have to be manually removed as shown above."

  info        : "The running configuration must be synchronized with the startup configuration after changes have been made and implemented.

If the running and startup router configurations are not synchronized properly and a router malfunctions, it will not restart with all of the recent changes incorporated.  If the recent changes were security related, then the routers would be vulnerable to attack.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance.

Review the running and boot configurations to determine if they are synchronized.

IOS Procedure: With online editing, the 'show running-config' command will only show the current running configuration settings, which are different from the IOS defaults. The 'show startup-config' command will show the NVRAM startup configuration. Compare the two configurations to ensure they are synchronized.

JUNOS Procedure: This will never be a finding. The active configuration is stored on flash as juniper.conf. A candidate configuration allows configuration changes while in configuration mode without initiating operational changes. The router implements the candidate configuration when it is committed; thereby, making it the new active configuration--at which time it will be stored on flash as juniper.conf and the old juniper.conf will become juniper.conf.1.

If running configuration and boot configurations are not the same, this is a finding."

Network devices may be distributed by the vendor pre-configured with an SNMP agent using the well-known SNMP community strings public for read only and private for read and write authorization.

  description : "NET1675 - SNMP privileged and non-privileged access."
  info        : "The network device must use different SNMP community names or groups for various levels of read and write access.

Numerous vulnerabilities exist with SNMP; therefore, without unique SNMP community names, the risk of compromise is dramatically increased. This is especially true with vendors default community names which are widely known by hackers and other networking experts. If a hacker gains access to these devices and can easily guess the name, this could result in denial of service, interception of sensitive information, or other destructive actions.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance.

Review the SNMP configuration of all managed nodes to ensure different community names (V1/2) or groups/users (V3) are configured for read-only and read-write access.  If unique community strings or accounts are not used for SNMP peers, this is a finding."
  solution    : "Configure the SNMP community strings on the network device and change them from the default values. SNMP community strings and user passwords must be unique and not match any other network device passwords. Different community strings (V1/2) or groups (V3) must be configured for various levels of read and write access."
