  description : "NET0162 - AG ingress ACL is not configured to secure enclave - 'Permit AG ACL'"
  info        : "The IAO/NSO will ensure premise router interfaces that connect to an AG (i.e., ISP) are configured with an ingress ACL that only permits packets with destination addresses within the site's address space.

 Any enclave with one or more AG connections will have to take additional steps to ensure that neither their network nor the NIPRNet is compromised. Without verifying the destination address of traffic coming from the site's AG, the premise router could be routing transit data from the Internet into the NIPRNet. This could also make the premise router vulnerable to a DoS attack as well as provide a backdoor into the NIPRNet. The DoD enclave must ensure that the premise router's ingress packet filter for any interface connected to an AG is configured to only permit packets with a destination address belonging to the DoD enclave's address block.

NOTE: Change 'AG_INGRESS_ACL_1' to the standard access list number for your organization.
NOTE: Change 'AG_IP_AND_NETMASK' to the approved AG IP and wilcard mask for your organization."
  solution    : "Insure the ingress ACL for any interface connected to an AAG is configured to only permit packets with a destination address belonging to the sites address block."

  description : "NET0408 - BGP must authenticate all peers"
  info        : "The network element must authenticate all BGP peers within the same or between autonomous systems (AS).

 As specified in RFC 793, TCP utilizes sequence checking to ensure proper ordering of received packets. RFC 793 also specifies that RST (reset) control flags should be processed immediately, without waiting for out of sequence packets to arrive. RFC 793 also requires that sequence numbers are checked against the window size before accepting data or control flags as valid. A router receiving an RST segment will close the TCP session with the BGP peer that is being spoofed; thereby, purging all routes learned from that BGP neighbor. A RST segment is valid as long as the sequence number is within the window. The TCP reset attack is made possible due to the requirements that Reset flags should be processed immediately and that a TCP endpoint must accept out of order packets that are within the range of a window size. This reduces the number of sequence number guesses the attack must make by a factor equivalent to the active window size. Each sequence number guess made by the attacker can be simply incremented by the receiving connections window size. The BGP peering session can protect itself against such an attack by authenticating each TCP segment. The TCP header options include an MD5 signature in every packet and are checked prior to the acceptance and processing of any TCP packet-including RST flags.

 One way to create havoc in a network is to advertise bogus routes to a network. A rogue router could send a fictitious routing update to convince a BGP router to send traffic to an incorrect or rogue destination. This diverted traffic could be analyzed to learn confidential information of the site's network, or merely used to disrupt the network's ability to effectively communicate with other networks. An autonomous system can advertise incorrect information by sending BGP updates messages to routers in a neighboring AS. A malicious AS can advertise a prefix originated from another AS and claim that it is the originator (prefix hijacking). Neighboring autonomous systems receiving this announcement will believe that the malicious AS is the prefix owner and route packets to it."

 An IP directed broadcast is a datagram sent to the broadcast address of a subnet that is not directly attached to the sending machine. The directed broadcast is routed through the network as a unicast packet until it arrives at the target subnet, where it is converted into a link-layer broadcast. Because of the nature of the IP addressing architecture, only the last router in the chain, which is connected directly to the target subnet, can conclusively identify a directed broadcast. IP directed broadcasts are used in the extremely common and popular smurf, or Denial of Service (DoS), attacks. In a smurf attack, the attacker sends ICMP echo requests from a falsified source address to a directed broadcast address, causing all the hosts on the target subnet to send replies to the falsified source. By sending a continuous stream of such requests, the attacker can create a much larger stream of replies, which can completely inundate the host whose address is being falsified. This service should be disabled on all interfaces when not needed to prevent smurf and DoS attacks.

  description : "NET0813 - The network element must authenticate all NTP messages received from NTP servers and peers."
  info        : "Since NTP is used to ensure accurate log file time stamp information, NTP could pose a security risk if a malicious user were able to falsify NTP information. To launch an attack on the NTP infrastructure, a hacker could inject time that would be accepted by NTP clients by spoofing the IP address of a valid NTP server. To mitigate this risk, the time messages must be authenticated by the client before accepting them as a time source.

Two NTP-enabled devices can communicate in either client-server mode or peer-to-peer mode (aka 'symmetric mode'). The peering mode is configured manually on the device and indicated in the outgoing NTP packets. The fundamental difference is the synchronization behavior: an NTP server can synchronize to a peer with better stratum, whereas it will never synchronize to its client regardless of the client's stratum. From a protocol perspective, NTP clients are no different from the NTP servers. The NTP client can synchronize to multiple NTP servers, select the best server and synchronize with it, or synchronize to the averaged value returned by the servers.

A hierarchical model can be used to improve scalability. With this implementation, an NTP client can also become an NTP server providing time to downstream clients at a higher stratum level and of decreasing accuracy than that of its upstream server. To increase availability, NTP peering can be used between NTP servers. In the event the device loses connectivity to its upstream NTP server, it will be able to choose time from one of its peers.

The NTP authentication model is opposite of the typical client-server authentication model. NTP authentication enables an NTP client or peer to authenticate time received from their servers and peers. It is not used to authenticate NTP clients because NTP servers do not care about the authenticity of their clients, as they never accept any time from them.

  description : "NET0820 - DNS servers must be defined for client resolver"
  info        : "The network element must have DNS servers defined if it is configured as a client resolver.

 The susceptibility of IP addresses to spoofing translates to DNS host name and IP address mapping vulnerabilities. For example, suppose a source host wishes to establish a connection with a destination host and queries a DNS server for the IP address of the destination host name.  If the response to this query is the IP address of a host operated by an attacker, the source host will establish a connection with the attackers host, rather than the intended target. The user on the source host might then provide logon, authentication, and other sensitive data.

Review the device configuration to ensure that DNS servers have been defined if it has been configured as a client resolver (name lookup). The configuration should look similar to one of the following examples:

ip domain-lookup

ip name-server 192.168.1.253

or

no ip domain-lookup

The first configuration example has DNS lookup enabled and hence has defined its DNS server. The second example has DNS lookup disabled.

NOTE: ip domain-lookup is enabled by default. Hence it may not be shown-depending on the IOS release. If it is enabled, it will be shown near the beginning of the configuration. If you don't allow the router to act as a DNS resolver you'll need to ensure 'no ip domain-lookup' is present in the configuration.

 Using a loopback address as the source address offers a multitude of uses for security, access, management, and scalability of routers. It is easier to construct appropriate ingress filters for router management plane traffic destined to the network management subnet since the source addresses will be from the range used for loopback interfaces instead of a larger range of addresses used for physical interfaces. Log information recorded by authentication and syslog servers will record the router's loopback address instead of the numerous physical interface addresses. TACACS+, RADIUS messages sent to management servers should use the loopback address as the source address.

 Vulnerability assessments must be reviewed by the SA and protocols must be approved by the IA staff before entering the enclave. Access Control Lists (ACLs) are the first line of defense in a layered security approach. They permit authorized packets and deny unauthorized packets based on port or service type. They enhance the posture of the network by not allowing packets to even reach a potential target within the security domain. The list provided are highly susceptible ports and services that should be blocked or limited as much as possible without adversely affecting customer requirements. Auditing packets attempting to penetrate the network but are stopped by an ACL will allow network administrators to broaden their protective ring and more tightly define the scope of operation. If the perimeter is in a Deny-by-Default posture and what is allowed through the filter is IAW DoD Instruction 8551.1, and if the permit rule is explicitly defined with explicit ports and protocols allowed, then all requirements related to PPS being blocked would be satisfied.

An attacker can use trace route responses to create a map of the subnets and hosts behind the perimeter router, just as they could do with pings. The traditional trace route relies on TTL - time exceeded responses from routers along the path and an ICMP port-unreachable message from the target host. In some Operating Systems such as UNIX, trace route will use UDP port 33400 and increment ports on each response. Since blocking these UDP ports alone will not block trace route capabilities along with blocking potentially legitimate traffic on a network, it is unnecessary to block them explicitly.

 A TCP connection consists of a three-way handshake message sequence. A connection request is transmitted by the originator, an acknowledgement is returned from the receiver, and then an acceptance of that acknowledgement is sent by the originator.

 An attacker's goal in this scenario is to cause a denial of service to the network or device by initiating a high volume of TCP packets, then never sending an acknowledgement, leaving connections in a half-opened state.  Without the device having a connection or time threshold for these half-opened sessions, the device risks being a victim of a denial of service attack.  Setting a TCP timeout threshold will instruct the device to shut down any incomplete connections. Services such as SSH, BGP, SNMP, LDP, etc. are some services that may be prone to these types of denial of service attacks.

Hence, any disruption to the RP or the control and management planes can result in mission critical network outages.

 In addition to control plane and management plane traffic that is in the router's receive path, the RP must also handle other traffic that must be punted to the RP-that is, the traffic must be fast or process switched.

To maintain network stability, the router must be able to securely handle specific control plane and management plane traffic that is destined to it, as well as other punted traffic.

 Using the ingress filter on forwarding interfaces is a method that has been used in the past to filter both forwarding path and receiving path traffic. However, this method does not scale well as the number of interfaces grows and the size of the ingress filters grow. Control plane policing can be used to increase security of routers and multilayer switches by protecting the RP from unnecessary or malicious traffic.

 Logging is a critical part of router security. Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs (syslog) can help identify configuration errors, understand past intrusions, troubleshoot service disruptions, and react to probes and scans of the network. Syslog levels 0-6 are the levels required to collect the necessary information to help in the recovery process.

Cisco IOS routers and switches use level 6 (informational) when logging packets that are dropped via access control list. (%SEC-6-IPACCESSLOGNP: list 1 denied 0 1.1.1.2 -> 1.1.1.1, 1 packet). Hence, it is imperative that log messages at level 6 are captured for further analysis and incident reporting. However, these messages do not need to go to the console, but must go to the syslog server.

To avoid being locked out of the console in the event of an intensive log message generation such as when a large number of packets are being dropped, you can implement any of the following:

1. Limit the amount of logging based on same packet matching via the access-list log-update threshold command. The configured threshold specifies how often syslog messages are generated and sent after the initial packet match on a per flow basis.
2. Rate-limit messages at specific severity levels destined to be logged at the console via logging rate-limit command.
3. Have only messages at levels 0-5 (or 0-4) go to the console and messages at level 0-6 go to the syslog server.

Secured modem devices must be able to authenticate users and must negotiate a key exchange before full encryption takes place.

The token provides a method of strong (two-factor) user authentication.  The token works in conjunction with a server to generate one-time user passwords that will change values at second intervals.

  description : "NET1970 - PAT is vulnerable to DNS cache poisoning"
  info        : "The IAO will ensure that the router or firewall software has been upgraded to mitigate the risk of DNS cache poisoning attack caused by a flawed PAT implementation using a predictable source port allocation method for DNS query traffic.

 DNS cache poisoning is an attack technique that allows an attacker to introduce forged DNS information into the cache of a caching name server. There are inherent deficiencies in the DNS protocol and defects in implementations that facilitate DNS cache poisoning. Name servers vulnerable to cache poisoning attacks are due to their use of insufficiently randomized transaction IDs and UDP source ports in the DNS queries that they produce, which may allow an attacker to more easily forge DNS answers that can poison DNS caches. To exploit these vulnerabilities an attacker must be able to cause a vulnerable DNS server to perform recursive DNS queries. Therefore, DNS servers that are only authoritative, or servers where recursion is not allowed, are not affected.

 The DNS protocol specification includes a transaction ID field of 16 bits. If the specification is correctly implemented and the transaction ID is randomly selected with a strong random number generator, an attacker will require, on average, 32,768 attempts to successfully predict the ID. Some flawed implementations may use a smaller number of bits for this transaction ID, meaning that fewer attempts will be needed. Furthermore, there are known errors with the randomness of transaction IDs that are generated by a number of implementations.

 Some current implementations allocate an arbitrary source port at startup (and sometimes selected at random) and reuse this source port for all outgoing queries. With other implementations, the source port for outgoing queries is fixed at the traditional assigned DNS server UDP port number 53. Because attacks against these vulnerabilities all rely on an attacker's ability to predict, the implementation of per-query source port randomization in the server presents a practical mitigation against these attacks within the boundaries of the current protocol specification. Randomized source ports can be used to gain approximately 16 additional bits of randomness in the data that an attacker must guess. Randomizing the ports adds a significant amount of attack resiliency.

 Routers, firewalls, proxies, and other gateway devices that perform NAT-more specifically Port Address Translation (PAT)-often rewrite source ports in order to track connection state. A flawed implementation of a PAT device using a predictiable source port allocation method can reduce any effectiveness of source port randomization implemented by name servers and stub resolvers. Henceforth, it is imperative that the router or firewall software has been upgraded or patched to reduce an attacker's opportunity for launching a DNS cache poisoning attack.

 NOTE: Regular NAT (allocating one public IP address for each private IP address) is not affected by this problem because it only rewrites layer 3 information and does not modify layer 4 header information of packets traversing the NAT device.
 NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

 Many of the known attacks in stateless autoconfiguration are defined in RFC 3756 were present in IPv4 ARP attacks. IPSec AH was originally suggested as mitigation for the link local attacks, but has since been found to have bootstrapping problems and to be very administrative intensive. Due to first requiring an IP address in order to set up the IPSec security association creates the chicken-before-the-egg dilemma. There are solutions being developed (Secure Neighbor Discovery and Cryptographic Generated Addressing) to secure these threats but are not currently available at the time of this writing.

 To mitigate these vulnerabilities, links that have no hosts connected such as the interface connecting to external gateways will be configured to suppress router advertisements.

 The Routing header is used by an IPv6 source to specify a list of intermediate nodes that a packet has to traverse on the path to its destination. If the packet cannot take the path, it is returned to the source node in an ICMPv6 unreachable error message. This header supports a function very similar to the IPv4 packet Loose Source Routing. The routing header can be used maliciously to send a packet through a path where less robust security is in place, than through the presumably preferred path by routing protocols. Use of the routing extension header has few legitimate uses other than as implemented by Mobile IPv6. The Routing header is identified by a Next Header value of 43 and should be filtered by type using an ACL.

 The Type 0 Routing Header (RFC 5095) is dangerous because it allows attackers to spoof source addresses and get traffic in response, rather than to the real owner of the address. Secondly, a packet with an allowed destination address could be sent through a Firewall only to bounce to a different node once inside using the Routing Header functionality. If the Type 0 Routing Header must be used, it must be used in conjunction with either the IPsec AH or the IPsec Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP) headers. The Routing Header is identified by a Next Header value of 43 (0x2B) and can be filtered by type using an ACL similar to: deny ipv6 any routing-type 0 log.

 The Type 1 Routing Header is defined by an abandoned specification called 'Nimrod Routing'. Assuming that most implementations will not recognize the Type 1 Routing Header, it must be dropped. When IETF standards explicitly require nodes to gracefully rejected invalid or deprecated options, in the case of Routing Headers, however, under certain conditions the specification allows a node to 'ignore the Routing Header and proceed to the next header in the packet' [RFC 2460, section 4.4 para 2]. This allows a spurious data channel of arbitrary size and must not be allowed.

 The Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF) switching mode replaces the traditional Cisco routing cache with a data structure that mirrors the entire system routing table. Because there is no need to build cache entries when traffic starts arriving for new destinations, CEF behaves more predictably when presented with large volumes of traffic addressed to many destinations-such as a SYN flood attacks that. Because many SYN flood attacks use randomized source addresses to which the hosts under attack will reply to, there can be a substantial amount of traffic for a large number of destinations that the router will have to handle. Consequently, routers configured for CEF will perform better under SYN floods directed at hosts inside the network than routers using the traditional cache.

 Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF) provides a mechanism for IP address spoof protection. When uRPF is enabled on an interface, the router examines all packets received as input on that interface to make sure that the source address and source interface appear in the routing table and match the interface on which the packet was received. If the packet was received from one of the best reverse path routes, the packet is forwarded as normal. If there is no reverse path route on the same interface from which the packet was received, it might mean that the source address was modified. If Unicast RPF does not find a reverse path for the packet, the packet is dropped.

 If internal nodes automatically configure an address based on a prefix from a bogus Router Advertisement a dangerous situation may exist. An internal host may contact an internal server which responds with a packet that could be routed outside of the network via default routing (because the routers do not recognize the destination address as an internal address.

 To prevent this, filtering should be applied to network interfaces between internal host LANs and internal server LANs to insure that source addresses have valid prefixes.

When uRPF is enabled on an interface, the router examines all packets received as input on that interface to make sure that the source address and source interface appear in the routing table and match the interface on which the packet was received. If the packet was received from one of the best reverse path routes, the packet is forwarded as normal. If there is no reverse path route on the same interface from which the packet was received, it might mean that the source address was modified. If Unicast RPF does not find a reverse path for the packet, the packet is dropped.

 If internal nodes automatically configure an address based on a prefix from a bogus Router Advertisement a dangerous situation may exist. An internal host may contact an internal server which responds with a packet that could be routed outside of the network via default routing (because the routers do not recognize the destination address as an internal address.

 To prevent this, filtering should be applied to network interfaces between internal host LANs and internal server LANs to insure that source addresses have valid prefixes.

 NOTE: Change 'OUT_TO_BACKBONE_ACL' to the access control list for IPv6 outbound to backbone connection filtering."

  description : "NET-IPV6-047 - IPv4 Interfaces in NAT-PT receive IPv6"
  info        : "The IAO/NSO will ensure interfaces supporting IPv4 in NAT-PT Architecture do not receive IPv6 traffic.

 Network Address Translation with Protocol Translation (NAT-PT), defined in [RFC2766], is a service that can be used to translate data sent between IP-heterogeneous nodes. NAT-PT translates a IPv4 datagram into a semantically equivalent IPv6 datagram or vice versa. For this service to work it has to be located in the connection point between the IPv4 network and the IPv6 network. The PT-part of the NAT-PT handles the interpretation and translation of the semantically equivalent IP header, either from IPv4 to IPv6 or from IPv6 to IPv4. Like NAT, NATPT also uses a pool of addresses which it dynamically assigns to the translated datagrams.

 The NAT-PT architecture is not one of the preferred DoD IPv6 transition paradigms due to the deprecation of NAT-PT within the DoD community. However, as described in the 'DoD IPv6 Guidance for Information Assurance (IA) Milestone Objective 3 (MO3) Requirements, some services/agencies may chose to implement this transition mechanism within an enclave. The following sub-sections provide guidelines for the use of NAT-PT within a controlled enclave.

 In addition to the single point of failure, the reduced performance of an application level gateway, coupled with limitations on the kinds of applications that work, decreases the overall value and utility of the network. NAT-PT also inhibits the ability to deploy security at the IP layer.

 NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

  info        : "The administrator must ensure the perimeter router is configured to drop all inbound and outbound IPv6 packets containing a Hop-by-Hop or Destination Option extension header with an undefined option type.

 The optional and extensible natures of the IPv6 extension headers require higher scrutiny since many implementations do not always drop packets with headers that it can't recognize and hence could cause a DoS on the target device. In addition, the type, length, value (TLV) formatting provides the ability for headers to be very large. According to the DoD IPv6 IA Guidance for MO3, extension headers with an unknown option type value should not be allowed into or out of any network (S0-C2-opt-3).

 Review the perimeter router or multi-layer switch configuration and determine if filters are bound to the applicable interfaces to drop all inbound and outbound IPv6 packets containing an undefined option type value regardless of whether they appear in a Hop-by-Hop or Destination Option header. Undefined values are 0x02, 0x03, 0x06 through 0x89 inclusive, 0x8B through 0xC1 inclusive, 0xC4 through 0xC8 inclusive, and anything greater than 0xC9.

 NOTE: Change 'IPV6_EGRESS_ACL' to the access control list for IPv6 inbound connection filtering and verify the ACL is applied to the proper interface."

  description : "NET-TUNL-013 - L2TP is terminated in the private network"
  info        : "L2TP must not pass into the private network of an enclave.

 Unlike GRE (a simple encapsulating header) L2TP is a full fledged communications protocol with control channel, data channels, and a robust command structure. In addition to PPP, other link layer types (called pseudowires) can be and are defined for delivery in L2TP by separate RFC documents. Further complexity is created by the capability to define vender-specific parameters beyond those defined in the L2TP specifications.

 The endpoint devices of an L2TP connection can be an L2TP Access Concentrator (LAC) in which case it inputs/outputs the layer 2 protocol to/from the L2TP tunnel. Otherwise it is an L2TP Network Server (LNS), in which case it inputs/outputs the layer 3 (IP) protocol to/from the L2TP tunnel. The specifications describe three reference models- LAC-LNS, LAC-LAC, and LNS-LNS, the first of which is the most common case. The LAC-LNS model allows a remote access user to reach his home network or ISP from a remote location. The remote access user either dials (or otherwise connects via layer 2) to a LAC device which tunnels his connection home to an awaiting LNS. The LAC could also be located on the remote user's laptop which connects to an LNS at home using some generic internet connection. The other reference models may be used for more obscure scenarios.

 Although the L2TP protocol does not contain encryption capability, it can be operated over IPSEC which would provide authentication and confidentiality. A remote user in the LAC-LNS model would most likely obtain a dynamically assigned IP address from the home network to ultimately use through the tunnel back to the home network. Secondly, the outer IP source address used to send the L2TP tunnel packet to the home network is likely to be unknown or highly variable. Thirdly, since the LNS provides the remote user with a dynamic IP address to use, the firewall at the home network would have to be dynamically updated to accept this address in conjunction with the outer tunnel address. Finally, there is also the issue of authentication of the remote user prior to divulging an acceptable IP address. As a result of all of these complications, the strict filtering rules applied to the IP-in-IP and GRE tunneling cases will likely not be possible in the L2TP scenario.

 In addition to the difficulty of enforcing addresses and endpoints (as explained above), the L2TP protocol itself is a security concern if allowed through a security boundary. In particular:

1) L2TP potentially allows link layer protocols to be delivered from afar. These protocols were intended for link-local scope only, are less defended, and not as well-known
2) The L2TP tunnels can carry IP packets that are very difficult to see and filter because of the additional layer 2 overhead
3) L2TP is highly complex and variable (vender-specific variability) and therefore would be a viable target that is difficult to defend. It is better left outside of the main firewall where less damage occurs if the L2TP-processing node is compromised.
4) Filtering can not be used to detect and prevent other unintended layer 2 protocols from being tunneled. The strength of the application layer code would have to be relied on to achieve this task.
5) Regardless of whether the L2TP is handled inside or outside of the main network, a secondary layer of IP filtering is required, therefore bringing it inside doesn't save resources. Therefore, it is not recommended to allow unencrypted L2TP packets across the security boundary into the network's protected areas. Reference the Backbone Transport STIG for additional L2TP guidance and use.

 NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

 ISATAP is an automatic tunnel mechanism that does not provide authentication such as IPSec. As a result of this limitation, ISATAP is thought of as a tool that is used inside the enclave among trusted hosts, which would limit it to internal attacks. ISATAP is a service versus a product, and is readily available to most users. If a user knows the ISATAP router IP address, they can essentially get onto the IPv6 intranet. To control the vulnerability of this tunnel mechanism, it is critical to control the use of protocol 41 and use IPv4 filters to control what IPv4 nodes can send protocol 41 packets to an ISATAP router interface.

 Review the router or multi-layer switch configuration and determine if L2TPv3 has been configured to provide transport across an IP network. If it has been configured, verify that the L2TPv3 session requires authentication."

  info        : "The administrator must ensure the that all L2TPv3 sessions are authenticated prior to transporting traffic.

 L2TPv3 sessions can be used to transport layer-2 protocols across an IP backbone. These protocols were intended for link-local scope only and are therefore less defended and not as well-known.
