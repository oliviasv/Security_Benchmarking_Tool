Rationale:

SNMP Version 3 provides security enhancements that are not available in SNMP Version 1 or SNMP Version 2c. SNMP Versions 1 and 2c transmit data between the SNMP server and SNMP agent in clear text. SNMP Version 3 adds authentication and privacy options to secure protocol operations.

For configuration purposes, the authentication and privacy options are grouped together into security models. Security models apply to users and groups, and are divided into the following three types:
*NoAuthPriv--No Authentication and No Privacy, which means that no security is applied to messages.
*AuthNoPriv--Authentication but No Privacy, which means that messages are authenticated.
*AuthPriv--Authentication and Privacy, which means that messages are authenticated and encrypted.

Rationale:

Limiting the number of connections protects from a DoS attack. The ASA uses the per-client limits and the embryonic connection limits to trigger TCP Intercept, which protects inside systems from a DoS attack perpetrated by flooding an interface with TCP SYN packets. An embryonic connection is a connection request that has not finished the necessary handshake between source and destination. TCP Intercept uses the SYN cookies algorithm to prevent TCP SYN-flooding attacks. A SYN-flooding attack consists of a series of SYN packets usually originating from spoofed IP addresses. The constant flood of SYN packets keeps the server SYN queue full, which prevents it from servicing connection requests.
