# This .audit file looks for file names that contain "dirty"
# words in common image and video formats. No actual file content
# analysis is performed. All matches are based on the name of the
# file.
#
# The regular expressions are short to match more files, but
# keep in mind that false positives can occur. For example,
# the string "anal" can occur in words like "canal" or "analysis".
