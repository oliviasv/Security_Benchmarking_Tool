  description : "1.1.8 Enabled Identity Protection to identify anomalous logon behavior"
  info        : "Azure Active Directory Identity Protection monitors account behaviors and enables organizations to configure automated responses to detected suspicious actions related to user identities.

Rationale:

Azure Active Directory Identity Protection helps to discover at risk or compromised accounts in your environment. Identity based attacks continue to be a top source for breaches. Enabling Identity Protection not only helps to monitor and provide reporting, but also helps to automatically respond to identity based risks.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
  solution    : "To setup Azure Active Directory Identity Protection, use the following steps:

Sign-on to your Azure portal as global administrator by going to https://portal.azure.com

In the Azure portal, click Marketplace.

In the applications list, click Identity.

Click Azure AD Identity Protection.

On the Azure AD Identity Protection blade, click Create.

Impact:

The impacts associated with implementation of this setting are highly dependent upon the specific response actions configured in Identity Protection."

  info           : "Enabling Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies for Microsoft Teams, blocks sensitive content when shared in teams or channels. Content to be scanned for specific types of data like social security numbers, credit card numbers, or passwords.

Rationale:

  solution       : "To enable DLP policies, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:

Select Compliance under Admin centers.

From the Microsoft 365 compliance center choose Policies select Data loss prevention

Select Data loss prevention.

Click Policy.

Click Create a policy.

Either start with a template or create a custom policy.

Provide a Name for your policy

At the Choose locations step, either choose Protect content in Exchange email, Teams chats and channel messages and OneDrive and SharePoint documents or select Let me choose specific locations. If you select Let me choose specific locations, ensure that Teams chat and channel messages is selected.

Ensure that the proper DLP rules are created for the type of content to be detected and what actions should be taken.

Impact:

Enabling a Teams DLP policy will allow sensitive data in Teams channels or chat messages to be detected or blocked.

Default Value:

This is not enabled by default."

  description : "4.10 Ensure that an anti-phishing policy has been created"
  info        : "By default, Office 365 includes built-in features that help protect your users from phishing attacks. Set up anti-phishing polices to increase this protection, for example by refining settings to better detect and prevent impersonation and spoofing attacks. The default policy applies to all users within the organization, and is a single view where you can fine-tune anti-phishing protection. Custom policies can be created and configured for specific users, groups or domains within the organization and will take precedence over the default policy for the scoped users.

Rationale:

Protects users from phishing attacks (like impersonation and spoofing), and uses safety tips to warn users about potentially harmful messages.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
  solution    : "To set the anti-phishing policy, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center:

Select Security and Compliance.

Expand Threat Management then select Policy.

Select ATP Anti-phishing.

Click Create to create a anti-phishing policy.

To create anti-phishing policy, use the Exchange Online PowerShell Module:

Connect to Exchange Online service using Connect-EXOPSSession.

Run the following Exchange Online PowerShell command:

New-AntiPhishPolicy -Name 'Office365 AntiPhish Policy'

Impact:

Turning on Anti-Phishing should not cause an impact, messages will be displayed when applicable."
