The lack of authorization-based access control could result in the immediate compromise and unauthorized access to sensitive information. All DoD systems must be properly configured to incorporate access control methods that do not rely solely on authentication for authorized access.

  Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization.

  Access control policies include identity-based policies, role-based policies, and attribute-based policies. Access enforcement mechanisms include access control lists, access control matrices, and cryptography.

  ALGs must use these policies and mechanisms to control access on behalf of the application for which it is acting as intermediary and access control mechanisms are required.

      info           : "Automatic session termination addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions in contrast to the termination of network connections that are associated with communications sessions (i.e., network disconnect). A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational information system. Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user access) without terminating network sessions.

  Session termination terminates all processes associated with a user's logical session except those processes that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated.

  This capability is typically reserved for specific system functionality where the system owner, data owner, or organization requires additional trigger events based on specific mission needs. Conditions or trigger events requiring automatic session termination can include, for example, targeted responses to certain types of incidents and time-of-day restrictions on information system use.

      info           : "Invalid user input occurs when a user inserts data or characters into an application's data entry fields and the application is unprepared to process that data. This results in unanticipated application behavior potentially leading to an application or information system compromise. Invalid input is one of the primary methods employed when attempting to compromise an application.

  Network devices with the functionality to perform application layer inspection may be leveraged to validate data content of network communications. Checking the valid syntax and semantics of information system inputs (e.g., character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values) verifies that inputs match specified definitions for format and content. Software typically follows well-defined protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed with metadata or control information. If network elements use attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages, then the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that receives the tainted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly. Pre-screening inputs prior to passing to interpreters prevents the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation helps to ensure accurate and correct inputs and prevent attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks.

  This requirement applies to gateways and firewalls that perform content inspection or have higher-layer proxy functionality.

      info           : "Application protocol anomaly detection examines application layer protocols such as HTTP to identify attacks based on observed deviations in the normal RFC behavior of a protocol or service. This type of monitoring allows for the detection of known and unknown exploits that exploit weaknesses of commonly used protocols.

  Since protocol anomaly analysis examines the application payload for patterns or anomalies, an HTTP proxy must be included in the ALG. This ALG will be configured to inspect inbound HTTP and HTTPS communications traffic to detect protocol anomalies such as malformed message and command insertion attacks. Note that if mutual authentication is enabled, there will be no way to inspect HTTPS traffic with MITM.

  NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
