Rationale:

Using the most recent MongoDB software version along with all applicable patches, helps limit the possibilities for vulnerabilities in the software. The installation version and/or patches applied should be selected according to the needs of the organization. At a minimum, the software version should be supported."
      solution       : "Upgrade to the latest version of the MongoDB software:

Backup the data set.

Download the binaries for the latest MongoDB revision from the MongoDB Download Page and store the binaries in a temporary location. The binaries download as compressed files that extract to the directory structure used by the MongoDB installation.

Shutdown the MongoDB instance.

Replace the existing MongoDB binaries with the downloaded binaries.

Restart the MongoDB instance.

Default Value:

Patches are not installed by default.

      info           : "Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of regulating access to resources based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise. A user is granted one or more roles that determine the users access to database resources and operations. Outside of role assignments, the user has no access to the system. MongoDB can use RBAC to govern access to MongoDB systems. MongoDB does not enable authorization by default.

Rationale:

When properly implemented, RBAC enables users to carry out a wide range of authorized tasks by dynamically regulating their actions according to flexible functions. This allows an organization to control employees access to all database tables through RBAC.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
