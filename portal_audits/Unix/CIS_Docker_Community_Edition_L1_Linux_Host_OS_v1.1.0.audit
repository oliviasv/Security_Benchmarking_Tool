Rationale:
Docker depends on /var/lib/docker as the default directory where all Docker related files, including the images, are stored. This directory might fill up fast and soon Docker and the host could become unusable. So, it is advisable to create a separate partition (logical volume) for storing Docker files."

Rationale:
You should follow infrastructure security best practices and harden your host OS. Keeping the host system hardened would ensure that the host vulnerabilities are mitigated. Not hardening the host system could lead to security exposures and breaches.
NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
      solution    : "You may consider various CIS Security Benchmarks for your container host. If you have other security guidelines or regulatory requirements to adhere to, please follow them as suitable in your environment.
Additionally, you can run a kernel with grsecurity and PaX. This would add many safety checks, both at compile-time and run-time. It is also designed to defeat many exploits and has powerful security features. These features do not require Docker-specific configuration, since those security features apply system-wide, independent of containers.
Impact:
None.

Keep a tab on these product updates and upgrade as frequently as when new security vulnerabilities are fixed or deemed correct for your organization.
Rationale:
By staying up to date on Docker updates, vulnerabilities in the Docker software can be mitigated. An educated attacker may exploit known vulnerabilities when attempting to attain access or elevate privileges. Not installing regular Docker updates may leave you with running vulnerable Docker software. It might lead to elevation privileges, unauthorized access or other security breaches. Keep a track of new releases and update as necessary.
NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

Rationale:
Docker allows you to share a directory between the Docker host and a guest container without limiting the access rights of the container. This means that you can start a container and map the / directory on your host to the container. The container will then be able to alter your host file system without any restrictions. In simple terms, it means that you can attain elevated privileges with just being a member of the docker group and then starting a container with mapped / directory on the host."

      description : "1.13 Ensure auditing is configured for Docker files and directories - /usr/bin/docker-runc"
      info        : "Audit /usr/bin/docker-runc, if applicable.
Rationale:
Apart from auditing your regular Linux file system and system calls, audit all Docker related files and directories. Docker daemon runs with root privileges. Its behavior depends on some key files and directories. /usr/bin/docker-runc is one such file. Docker now relies on containerd and runC to spawn containers. It must be audited, if applicable."
      solution    : "Add a rule for /usr/bin/docker-runc file.
For example,
Add the line as below in /etc/audit/audit.rules file:
-w /usr/bin/docker-runc -k docker
Then, restart the audit daemon. For example,
service auditd restart
Impact:
Auditing generates quite big log files. Ensure to rotate and archive them periodically. Also, create a separate partition of audit to avoid filling root file system.
Default Value:
By default, Docker related files and directories are not audited. The file/usr/bin/docker-runc may not be available on the system. In that case, this recommendation is not applicable."

      info        : "Do not keep a large number of container images on the same host. Use only tagged images as appropriate.
Rationale:
Tagged images are useful to fall back from \"latest\" to a specific version of an image in production. Images with unused or old tags may contain vulnerabilities that might be exploited, if instantiated. Additionally, if you fail to remove unused images from the system and there are various such redundant and unused images, the host filesystem may become full and could lead to denial of service.
NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
      solution    : "Keep the set of the images that you actually need and establish a workflow to remove old or stale images from the host. Additionally, use features such as pull-by-digest to get specific images from the registry.
Additionally, you can follow below set of steps to find out unused images on the system and delete them.
Step 1 Make a list of all image IDs that are currently instantiated by executing below command:
docker images --quiet | xargs docker inspect --format '{{ .Id }}: Image={{ .Config.Image }}'
Step 2: List all the images present on the system by executing below command:
docker images
Step 3: Compare the list of image IDs populated from Step 1 and Step 2 and find out images that are currently not being instantiated.
Step 4: Decide if you want to keep the images that are not currently in use. If not delete them by executing below command:
docker rmi $IMAGE_ID
Impact:
None
Default Value:
Images and layered filesystems remain accessible on the host until the administrator removes all tags that refer to those images or layers."

      info        : "Do not keep a large number of containers on the same host.
Rationale:
The flexibility of containers makes it easy to run multiple instances of applications and indirectly leads to Docker images that exist at varying security patch levels. It also means that you are consuming host resources that otherwise could have been used for running 'useful' containers. Having more than just the manageable number of containers on a particular host makes the situation vulnerable to mishandling, misconfiguration and fragmentation. Thus, avoid container sprawl and keep the number of containers on a host to a manageable total."
      solution    : "Periodically check your container inventory per host and clean up the stopped containers using the below command:
docker container prune

Impact:
If you keep way too few number of containers per host, then perhaps you are not utilizing your host resources very adequately.
Default Value:
By default, Docker does not restrict the number of containers you may have on a host."
