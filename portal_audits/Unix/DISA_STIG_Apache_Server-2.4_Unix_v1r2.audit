  info        : "Many vulnerabilities are associated with older versions of web server software. As hot fixes and patches are issued, these solutions are included in the next version of the server software. Maintaining the web server at a current version makes the efforts of a malicious user to exploit the web service more difficult.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

  description : "AS24-U1-000970 - The Apache web server htpasswd files (if present) must reflect proper ownership and permissions."
  info        : "In addition to OS restrictions, access rights to files and directories can be set on a website using the web server software. That is, in addition to allowing or denying all access rights, a rule can be specified that allows or denies partial access rights. For example, users can be given read-only access rights to files to view the information but not change the files.

This check verifies that the htpasswd file is only accessible by System Administrators (SAs) or Web Managers, with the account running the web service having group permissions of read and execute. 'htpasswd' is a utility used by Netscape and Apache to provide for password access to designated websites."
  solution    : "Ensure the SA or Web Manager account owns the 'htpasswd' file.

Ensure permissions are set to '550'."

  info        : "The HTTP 1.1 protocol supports several request methods that are rarely used and potentially high risk. For example, methods such as PUT and DELETE are rarely used and should be disabled in keeping with the primary security principal of minimize features and options. Also, since the usage of these methods is typically to modify resources on the web server, they should be explicitly disallowed. Normal web server operation will typically require allowing only the GET, HEAD, and POST request methods. This will allow for downloading of web pages and submitting information to web forms. The OPTIONS request method will also be allowed as it is used to request which HTTP request methods are allowed."
