      info        : "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications.

Rationale:

Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw.

This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate partition for /tmp."

tmpfs/tmptmpfs     defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime  0 0

Run the following commands to enable systemd /tmp mounting:

systemctl unmask tmp.mount
systemctl enable tmp.mount

Edit /etc/systemd/system/local-fs.target.wants/tmp.mount to configure the /tmp mount:

[Mount]
What=tmpfs
Where=/tmp
Type=tmpfs
Options=mode=1777,strictatime,noexec,nodev,nosuid

Impact:

Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition.

Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a default installation a disk-based /tmp will essentially have the whole disk available, as it only creates a single / partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp as with tmpfs will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily.

/tmp utalizing tmpfs can be resized using the size={size} parameter on the Options line on the tmp.mount file

# update-grub

Impact:

If password protection is enabled, only the designated superuser can edit a Grub 2 menu item by pressing 'e' or access the GRUB 2 command line by pressing 'c'

If GRUB 2 is set up to boot automatically to a password-protected menu entry the user has no option to back out of the password prompt to select another menu entry. Holding the SHIFT key will not display the menu in this case. The user must enter the correct username and password. If unable, the configuration files will have to be edited via the LiveCD or other means to fix the problem

You can add --unrestricted to the menu entries to allow the system to boot without entering a password. Password will still be required to edit menu items.

It can also be used to glean confidential information from a core file. The system provides the ability to set a soft limit for core dumps, but this can be overridden by the user.

Rationale:

Setting a hard limit on core dumps prevents users from overriding the soft variable. If core dumps are required, consider setting limits for user groups (see limits.conf(5) ). In addition, setting the fs.suid_dumpable variable to 0 will prevent setuid programs from dumping core."
          solution    : "Add the following line to /etc/security/limits.conf or a /etc/security/limits.d/* file:

* hard core 0

Set the following parameter in /etc/sysctl.conf or a /etc/sysctl.d/* file:

fs.suid_dumpable = 0

Run the following command to set the active kernel parameter:

# sysctl -w fs.suid_dumpable=0

edit /etc/systemd/coredump.conf and add/modify the following lines:

Rationale:

Newer patches may contain security enhancements that would not be available through the latest full update. As a result, it is recommended that the latest software patches be used to take advantage of the latest functionality. As with any software installation, organizations need to determine if a given update meets their requirements and verify the compatibility and supportability of any additional software against the update revision that is selected.

      solution    : "Use your package manager to update all packages on the system according to site policy.
Run the following command to update all packages following local site policy guidance on applying updates and patches:

# apt upgrade
OR
# apt dist-upgrade

Notes:

Site policy may mandate a testing period before install onto production systems for available updates.

upgrade: upgrade is used to install the newest versions of all packages currently installed on the system from the sources enumerated in /etc/apt/sources.list. Packages currently installed with new versions available are retrieved and upgraded; under no circumstances are currently installed packages removed, or packages not already installed retrieved and installed. New versions of currently installed packages that cannot be upgraded without changing the install status of another package will be left at their current version. An update must be performed first so that apt knows that new versions of packages are available.

dist-upgrade: dist-upgrade in addition to performing the function of upgrade, also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions of packages; apt has a 'smart' conflict resolution system, and it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the expense of less important ones if necessary. So, dist-upgrade command may remove some packages. The /etc/apt/sources.list file contains a list of locations from which to retrieve desired package files. See also apt_preferences(5) for a mechanism for overriding the general settings for individual packages."

This allows the system to verify that it has received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no corresponding SYN in the queue.

Rationale:

Attackers use SYN flood attacks to perform a denial of service attacked on a system by sending many SYN packets without completing the three way handshake. This will quickly use up slots in the kernel's half-open connection queue and prevent legitimate connections from succeeding. SYN cookies allow the system to keep accepting valid connections, even if under a denial of service attack."

Notes:

This recommendation assumes that recommendation 4.2.1.5, 'Ensure rsyslog is configured to send logs to a remote log host' has been implemented.

As noted in the journald man pages, journald logs may be exported to rsyslog either through the process mentioned here, or through a facility like systemd-journald.service. There are trade-offs involved in each implementation, where ForwardToSyslog will immediately capture all events (and forward to an external log server, if properly configured), but may not capture all boot-up activities. Mechanisms such as systemd-journald.service, on the other hand, will record bootup events, but may delay sending the information to rsyslog, leading to the potential for log manipulation prior to export. Be aware of the limitations of all tools employed to secure a system.

      info        : "This variable limits the ciphers that SSH can use during communication.

Rationale:

Weak ciphers that are used for authentication to the cryptographic module cannot be relied upon to provide confidentiality or integrity, and system data may be compromised

The DES, Triple DES, and Blowfish ciphers, as used in SSH, have a birthday bound of approximately four billion blocks, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain cleartext data via a birthday attack against a long-duration encrypted session, aka a 'Sweet32' attack

The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, does not properly combine state data with key data during the initialization phase, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct plaintext-recovery attacks against the initial bytes of a stream by sniffing network traffic that occasionally relies on keys affected by the Invariance Weakness, and then using a brute-force approach involving LSB values, aka the 'Bar Mitzvah' issue

The passwords used during an SSH session encrypted with RC4 can be recovered by an attacker who is able to capture and replay the session

Error handling in the SSH protocol; Client and Server, when using a block cipher algorithm in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, makes it easier for remote attackers to recover certain plaintext data from an arbitrary block of ciphertext in an SSH session via unknown vectors

The mm_newkeys_from_blob function in monitor_wrap.c, when an AES-GCM cipher is used, does not properly initialize memory for a MAC context data structure, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended ForceCommand and login-shell restrictions via packet data that provides a crafted callback address
