The intent of this control is to resemble control-alt-delete on Windows Systems as a means of quickly locking the screen. If the user of the system is stepping away from the computer the best practice is to lock the screen and setting a hot corner is an appropriate method.

Ensuring the user has a quick method to lock their screen may reduce opportunity for individuals in close physical proximity of the device to see screen contents."

One very large weakness in data protection with FileVault is the level of protection on backup volumes. If the internal drive is encrypted but the external backup volume that goes home in the same laptop bag is not it is self-defeating. Apple tries to make this mistake easily avoided by providing a checkbox to enable encryption when setting-up a time machine backup. Using this option does require some password management, particularly if a large drive is used with multiple computers. A unique complex password to unlock the drive can be stored in keychains on multiple systems for ease of use.

While some portable drives may contain non-sensitive data and encryption may make interoperability with other systems difficult backup volumes should be protected just like boot volumes.

These settings are user controlled and can be changed without Administrator privileges unless controlled through MCX settings or Parental Controls. Unlike Windows Auto-run the optical media is accessed through Operating System applications, those same applications can open and access the media directly.

In earlier versions of the Operating System repair permissions checked the receipt files of installed software and ensured that the existing permissions in the file system matched what the receipts said it should. System integrity protection manages and blocks permission to certain directories continuously.

      info        : "With macOS 10.12 Sierra Apple has introduced Siri from iOS to macOS. While there are data spillage concerns with use of software data gathering personal assistants the risk here does not seem greater in sending queries to Apple through Siri than in sending search terms in a browser to Google or Microsoft. While it is possible that Siri will be used for local actions rather than Internet searches which could, in theory, tell Apple about confidential Programs and Projects that should not be revealed this appears be an edge use case.

In cases where sensitive and protected data is processed and Siri could help a user navigate their machine and expose that information it should be disabled. Siri does need to phone home to Apple so it should not be available from air-gapped networks as part of it's requirements.

Most of the use case data published has shown that Siri is a tremendous time saver on iOS where multiple screens and menus need to be navigated through. Information like sports scores, weather, movie times and simple to-do items on existing calendars can be easily found with Siri. None of the standard use cases should be more risky than already approved activity. Where 'normal' user activity is already limited Siri use should be controlled as well.

      description : "7.13 Apple Watch features with MacOS"
      info        : "With the release of macOS 10.12 Apple introduced a feature where the owner of an Apple Watch can lock and unlock their screen simply by being within range of a 10.12 computer when both devices are using the same AppleID with iCloud active. The benefit of not leaving the computer unlocked while the user is out of sight and readying the computer to resume work when the user returns without having to type in a password or insert a smartcard does seem attractive to people who have the Apple Watch. It is a continuation of other features like hand-off and continuity for the multiple Apple products users who have grown to expect their devices to work together.

For the screen unlock capability in particular it may not be attractive to organizations that are managing Apple devices and credentials. The capability allows a user to unlock their computer tied to an Enterprise account with a personal token that is not managed or controlled by the Enterprise. If the user loses their watch revoking the credential that can unlock the screen might be problematic.

Unless Enterprise control of the watch as a token tied to a user identity can be achieved Apple Watches should not be used for screen unlocks. The risk of an auto-lock based on the user being out of proximity may still be acceptable if possible to do lock only.

This functionality does require the computer to be logged in to iCloud. If iCloud is disabled the Apple watch lock and unlock will not be possible.

A profile may be used to control unlock functionality.

A full explanation of macOS logging behavior is beyond the scope of this Benchmark. These changes impact previous logging controls from macOS Benchmarks. At this point many of the syslog controls have been or are being removed since the old logging methods have been deprecated. Controls that still appear useful will be retained.

      description : "7.16 AirDrop security considerations"
      info        : "AirDrop is Apple's built-in on demand ad hoc file exchange system that is compatible with both macOS and iOS. It uses Bluetooth LE for discovery that limits connectivity to Mac or iOS users that are in close proximity. Depending on the setting it allows everyone or only Contacts to share files when they are nearby to each other.

In many ways this technology is far superior to the alternatives. The file transfer is done over a TLS encrypted session, does not require any open ports that are required for file sharing, does not leave file copies on email servers or within cloud storage, and allows for the service to be mitigated so that only people already trusted and added to contacts can interact with you.

Even with all of these positives some environments may wish to disable AirDrop. Organizations where Bluetooth and Wireless are not used will disable AirDrop by blocking it's necessary interfaces. Organizations that have disabled USB and other pluggable storage mechanisms and have blocked all unmanaged cloud and transfer solutions for DLP may want to disable AirDrop as well.

AirDrop should be used with Contacts only to limit attacks.
