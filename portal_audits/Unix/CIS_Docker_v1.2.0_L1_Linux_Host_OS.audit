Rationale:

You should follow infrastructure security best practices and harden your host OS. Keeping the host system hardened will ensure that host vulnerabilities are mitigated. Not hardening the host system could lead to security exposures and breaches.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

Impact:

None.

Default Value:

By default, the host has factory setting and is not hardened."

You should keep a tab on these product updates and upgrade as frequently as possible in line with the general IT security policy of your organization.

Rationale:

By staying up to date on Docker updates, vulnerabilities in the software can be mitigated. An experienced attacker may be able to exploit known vulnerabilities resulting in them being able to attain inappropriate access or to elevate their privileges. If you do not ensure that Docker is running at the most current release consistent with the requirements of of your application, you may introduce unwanted behaviour and it is therefore important to ensure that you monitor software versions and upgrade in a timely fashion."
      solution    : "You should monitor versions of Docker releases and make sure your software is updated as required.

Impact:

You should perform a risk assessment regarding Docker version updates and review how they may impact your operations. You should be aware that third-party products that use Docker may require older major versions of Docker to be supported, and this should be reviewed in line with the general IT security policy of your organization, particularly where security vulnerabilities in older versions have been publicly disclosed.

Rationale:

Docker depends on /var/lib/docker as the default directory where all Docker related files, including the images, are stored.

Rationale:

Docker allows you to share a directory between the Docker host and a guest container without limiting the access rights of the container. This means that you can start a container and map the / directory on your host to the container. The container would then be able to modify your host file system without any restrictions. This means that you could gain elevated privileges simply by being a member of the docker group and subsequently start a container which maps the root / directory on the host."
      solution    : "You should remove any untrusted users from the docker group. Additionally, you should not create a mapping of sensitive directories from the host to container volumes.

Provided the proceeding instructions are implemented, rights to build and execute containers as normal user would be restricted.

      description : "1.2.12 Ensure auditing is configured for Docker files and directories - /usr/sbin/runc"
      info        : "Audit /usr/sbin/runc if applicable

Rationale:

As well as auditing the normal Linux file system and system calls, you should also audit all Docker related files and directories. The Docker daemon runs with root privileges and its behavior depends on some key files and directories. /usr/sbin/runc is one such file, and as such it should be audited."
      solution    : "You should add a rule for /usr/sbin/runc file.
For example:
Add the line below to the /etc/audit/audit.rules file:

-w /usr/sbin/runc -k docker

Then restart the audit daemon.
For example:

service auditd restart

Impact:

Auditing can generate large log files. You should ensure that these are rotated and archived periodically. A separate partition should also be created for audit logs to avoid filling up any other critical partition.

Default Value:

By default, Docker related files and directories are not audited. The file/usr/sbin/runc may not be present on the system and in that case this recommendation is not applicable."

      info        : "You should not keep a large number of container images on the same host. Use only tagged images as appropriate.

Rationale:

Tagged images are useful if you need to fall back from the 'latest' version to a specific version of an image in production. Images with unused or old tags may contain vulnerabilities that might be exploited if instantiated.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
      solution    : "You should keep only the images that you actually need and establish a workflow to remove old or stale images from the host. Additionally, you should use features such as pull-by-digest to get specific images from the registry.
You can follow the steps below to find unused images on the system so they can be deleted.
Step 1 Make a list of all image IDs that are currently instantiated by executing the command below:

docker images --quiet | xargs docker inspect --format '{{ .Id }}: Image={{ .Config.Image }}'

Step 2: List all the images present on the system by executing the command below:

docker images

Step 3: Compare the list of image IDs created from Step 1 and Step 2 to find out images which are currently not being instantiated.
Step 4: Decide if you want to keep the images that are not currently in use. If they are not needed, delete them by executing the following command:

docker rmi $IMAGE_ID

Alternatively, the docker system prune command can be used to remove dangling images which are not tagged or, if necessary, all images that are not currently used by a running container when used with the -a option.

Impact:

docker system prune -a removes all exited containers as well as all images and volumes that are not referenced by running containers, including for UCP and DTR. This can present problems under three circumstances:

In Offline environments, where image removal would result in needing to reload the images to the host.

On DTR hosts, where nodes will not automatically rejoin the DTR cluster and docker system prune -a may remove DTR volumes and erase all DTR state.

On DTR or UCP hosts where docker system prune -a is simultaneously issued on a majority of UCP managers or DTR nodes whilst the corresponding component UCP or DTR is stopped. This could result in loss of quorum and/or data.

Default Value:

Images and layered filesystems remain accessible on the host until the administrator removes all tags that refer to those images or layers."

      info        : "You should not keep a large number of containers on the same host.

Rationale:

The flexibility of containers makes it easy to run multiple instances of applications and therefore indirectly leads to Docker images that can exist at varying security patch levels. It also means that you are consuming host resources that otherwise could have been used for running 'useful' containers. Having more than just an essential number of containers on a particular host makes the system vulnerable to mishandling, misconfiguration and fragmentation. You should therefore keep the number of containers on a given host to the minimum number commensurate with serving production applications.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
      solution    : "You should periodically check your container inventory on each host and clean up containers which are not in active use with the command below:

docker container prune

Impact:

You should retain containers that are actively in use, and delete ones which are no longer needed.

By default, Docker does not restrict the number of containers you may have on a host."
