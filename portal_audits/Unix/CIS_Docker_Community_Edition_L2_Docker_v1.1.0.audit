Rationale:
The Linux kernel user namespace support in Docker daemon provides additional security for the Docker host system. It allows a container to have a unique range of user and group IDs which are outside the traditional user and group range utilized by the host system.
For example, the root user will have expected administrative privilege inside the container but can effectively be mapped to an unprivileged UID on the host system."

System administrators typically define cgroups under which containers are supposed to run. Even if cgroups are not explicitly defined by the system administrators, containers run under docker cgroup by default.
It is possible to attach to a different cgroup other than that is the default. This usage should be monitored and confirmed. By attaching to a different cgroup than the one that is a default, it is possible to share resources unevenly and thus might starve the host for resources."

Rationale:
The base device size can be increased at daemon restart. Increasing the base device size allows all future images and containers to be of the new base device size. A user can use this option to expand the base device size however shrinking is not permitted. This value affects the system-wide base empty filesystem that may already be initialized and inherited by pulled images.
Though the file system does not allot the increased size if it is empty, it will use more space for the empty case depending upon the device size. This may cause a denial of service by ending up in file system being over-allocated or full.

Rationale:
Dockers out-of-the-box authorization model is all or nothing. Any user with permission to access the Docker daemon can run any Docker client command. The same is true for callers using Dockers remote API to contact the daemon. If you require greater access control, you can create authorization plugins and add them to your Docker daemon configuration. Using an authorization plugin, a Docker administrator can configure granular access policies for managing access to Docker daemon.
Third party integrations of Docker may implement their own authorization models to require authorization with the Docker daemon outside of docker's native authorization plugin (i.e. Kubernetes, Cloud Foundry, Openshift)."

      info        : "You can choose to apply your custom seccomp profile at the daemon-wide level if needed and override Docker's default seccomp profile.
Rationale:
A large number of system calls are exposed to every userland process with many of them going unused for the entire lifetime of the process. Most of the applications do not need all the system calls and thus benefit by having a reduced set of available system calls. The reduced set of system calls reduces the total kernel surface exposed to the application and thus improvises application security.
You could apply your own custom seccomp profile instead of Docker's default seccomp profile. Alternatively, if Docker's default profile is good for your environment, you can choose to ignore this recommendation.
NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
      solution    : "By default, Docker's default seccomp profile is applied. If this is good for your environment, no action is necessary. Alternatively, if you choose to apply your own seccomp profile, use the --seccomp-profile flag at daemon start or put it in the daemon runtime parameters file.
dockerd --seccomp-profile </path/to/seccomp/profile>
Impact:
A misconfigured seccomp profile could possibly interrupt your container environment. Docker-default blocked calls have been carefully scrutinized.

Rationale:
Content trust provides the ability to use digital signatures for data sent to and received from remote Docker registries. These signatures allow client-side verification of the integrity and publisher of specific image tags. This ensures provenance of container images."
      solution    : "To enable content trust in a bash shell, enter the following command:

Alternatively, set this environment variable in your profile file so that content trust in enabled on every login.
Impact:
In an environment where DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST is set, you are required to follow trust procedures while working with images - build, create, pull, pushand run. You can use the --disable-content-trust flag to run individual operations on tagged images without content trust on an as-needed basis but that defeats the purpose of enabling content trust and hence, should be avoided wherever possible.
Note: Content trust is currently only available for users of the public Docker Hub. It is currently not available for the Docker Trusted Registry or for private registries.

Rationale:
setuid and setgid permissions could be used for elevating privileges. While these permissions are at times legitimately needed, these could potentially be used in privilege escalation attacks.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

Impact:
Above command breaks all the executables that depend on setuid or setgid permissions including the legitimate ones.

      info        : "Do not use Docker's default bridge docker0. Use docker's user-defined networks for container networking.
Rationale:
Docker connects virtual interfaces created in the bridge mode to a common bridge called docker0. This default networking model is vulnerable to ARP spoofing and MAC flooding attacks since there is no filtering applied.
NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
      solution    : "Follow Docker documentation and setup a user-defined network. Run all the containers in the defined network.
Impact:
You have to manage the user-defined networks.
Default Value:
By default, docker runs containers on its docker0 bridge."

Rationale:
Docker Swarm uses mutual TLS for clustering operations amongst its nodes. Certificate rotation ensures that in an event such as compromised node or key, it is difficult to impersonate a node. By default, node certificates are rotated every 90 days. You should rotate it more often or as appropriate in your environment.

Rationale:
Docker Swarm uses mutual TLS for clustering operations amongst its nodes. Certificate rotation ensures that in an event such as compromised node or key, it is difficult to impersonate a node. Node certificates depend upon root CA certificates. For operational security, it is important to rotate these frequently. Currently, root CA certificates are not rotated automatically. You should thus establish a process to rotate it at the desired frequency.

Rationale:
Separating the management plane traffic from data plane traffic ensures that these traffics are on their respective paths. These paths could then be individually monitored and could be tied to different traffic control policies and monitoring. It also ensures that management plane is always reachable despite the huge volume of data flow.
NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

You would require 2 network interface cards per node.

By default, the data plane traffic is not separated from management plane traffic."
