The attacker must attempt to change to another user account with normal or elevated privileges in order to proceed. Auditing successful and unsuccessful attempts to switch to another user account mitigates this risk."

      info        : "Setting a lockout time period of 15 minutes is an effective deterrent against brute forcing that also makes allowances for legitimate mistakes by users. When three invalid logon attempts are made, the account will be locked."
      solution    : "This setting may be enforced using the \"Passcode Policy\" configuration profile or by a directory server.

The following two lines within the configuration enforce lockout expiration to 15 minutes:

<key>autoEnableInSeconds</key>
<integer>900</integer>

To set the password policy without a configuration profile, run the following command to save a copy of the current pwpolicy account policy file:

sudo pwpolicy getaccountpolicies | tail -n +2 > pwpolicy.plist

Open the generated file in a text editor and ensure it contains the following text after the opening <dict> tag and before the closing </dict> tag.

Replace <dict/> first with <dict></dict> if necessary.

<key>policyCategoryAuthentication</key>
<array>
<dict>
<key>policyContent</key>
<string>(policyAttributeFailedAuthentications < policyAttributeMaximumFailedAuthentications) OR (policyAttributeCurrentTime > (policyAttributeLastFailedAuthenticationTime + autoEnableInSeconds))</string>

<dict>
<key>autoEnableInSeconds</key>
<integer>900</integer>
<key>policyAttributeMaximumFailedAuthentications</key>
<integer>3</integer>
</dict>
</dict>
</array>

If the line <key>policyCategoryAuthentication</key> already exists, the following text should be used instead and inserted after the first <array> tag that follows it:

<dict>
<key>policyContent</key>
<string>(policyAttributeFailedAuthentications < policyAttributeMaximumFailedAuthentications) OR (policyAttributeCurrentTime > (policyAttributeLastFailedAuthenticationTime + autoEnableInSeconds))</string>

<integer>900</integer>
<key>policyAttributeMaximumFailedAuthentications</key>
<integer>3</integer>
</dict>
</dict>

After saving the file and exiting to the command prompt, run the following command to load the new policy file:

sudo pwpolicy setaccountpolicies pwpolicy.plist

NOTE: Updates to password restrictions must be thoroughly evaluated in a test environment. Mistakes in configuration may block password change and local user creation operations, as well as, lock out all local users, including administrators."
