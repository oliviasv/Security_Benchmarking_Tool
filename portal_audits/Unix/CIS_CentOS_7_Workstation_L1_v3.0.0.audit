      description : "1.1.2 Ensure /tmp is configured - mount"
      info        : "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications.

Notes:

If an entry for /tmp exists in /etc/fstab it will take precedence over entries in the tmp.mount file.

tmpfs can be resized using the size={size} parameter in /etc/fstab or on the Options line in the tmp.mount file. If we don't specify the size, it will be half the RAM.

Resize tmpfs examples:

/etc/fstab

  tmpfs   /tmp         tmpfs   rw,noexec,nodev,nosuid,size=2G          0  0

tmp.mount

  [Mount]

  What=tmpfs

  Where=/tmp

  Type=tmpfs

  Options=mode=1777,strictatime,size=2G,noexec,nodev,nosuid

Rationale:

Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw.

This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate partition for /tmp."
      solution    : "Create or update an entry for /tmp in either /etc/fstab OR in a systemd tmp.mount file:
If /etc/fstab is used:

Configure /etc/fstab as appropriate.

  Example:
  tmpfs/tmptmpfs     defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime  0 0

Run the following command to remount /tmp

  # mount -o remount,noexec,nodev,nosuid /tmp

OR
If systemd tmp.mount file is used:

Run the following command to create the file /etc/systemd/system/tmp.mount if it doesn't exist:

  # [ ! -f /etc/systemd/system/tmp.mount ] && cp -v /usr/lib/systemd/system/tmp.mount /etc/systemd/system/

Edit the file /etc/systemd/system/tmp.mount:

  [Mount]
  What=tmpfs
  Where=/tmp
  Type=tmpfs
  Options=mode=1777,strictatime,noexec,nodev,nosuid

Run the following command to reload the systemd daemon:

  # systemctl daemon-reload

Run the following command to unmask tmp.mount:

  # systemctl unmask tmp.mpunt

Run the following command to enable and start tmp.mount:

  # systemctl enable --now tmp.mount




Impact:

Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition.

Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a default installation a disk-based /tmp will essentially have the whole disk available, as it only creates a single / partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp as with tmpfs will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily.

Notes:

An entry for /dev/shm in /etc/fstab will take precedence.

tmpfs can be resized using the size={size} parameter in /etc/fstab. If we don't specify the size, it will be half the RAM.

Notes:

This recommendation is designed around the grub2 bootloader, if LILO or another bootloader is in use in your environment enact equivalent settings. Replace '/boot/grub2/grub.cfg with the appropriate grub configuration file for your environment

For older grub2 based systems:

The superuser/user information and password should not be contained in the /etc/grub.d/00_header file. The information can be placed in any /etc/grub.d file as long as that file is incorporated into grub.cfg. The user may prefer to enter this data into a custom file, such as /etc/grub.d/40_custom so it is not overwritten should the Grub package be updated.

If placing the information in a custom file, do not include the 'cat << EOF' and 'EOF' lines as the content is automatically added from these files.

Rationale:

Requiring a boot password upon execution of the boot loader will prevent an unauthorized user from entering boot parameters or changing the boot partition. This prevents users from weakening security (e.g. turning off SELinux at boot time)."

EOF

Run the following command to update the grub2 configuration:

# grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

Impact:

If password protection is enabled, only the designated superuser can edit a Grub 2 menu item by pressing 'e' or access the GRUB 2 command line by pressing 'c'

If GRUB 2 is set up to boot automatically to a password-protected menu entry the user has no option to back out of the password prompt to select another menu entry. Holding the SHIFT key will not display the menu in this case. The user must enter the correct username and password. If unable, the configuration files will have to be edited via the LiveCD or other means to fix the problem

You can add --unrestricted to the menu entries to allow the system to boot without entering a password. Password will still be required to edit menu items."

Notes:

This recommendation is designed around the grub2 bootloader, if LILO or another bootloader is in use in your environment enact equivalent settings. Replace '/boot/grub2/grub.cfg with the appropriate grub configuration file for your environment

For older grub2 based systems:

The superuser/user information and password should not be contained in the /etc/grub.d/00_header file. The information can be placed in any /etc/grub.d file as long as that file is incorporated into grub.cfg. The user may prefer to enter this data into a custom file, such as /etc/grub.d/40_custom so it is not overwritten should the Grub package be updated.

If placing the information in a custom file, do not include the 'cat << EOF' and 'EOF' lines as the content is automatically added from these files.

Rationale:

Requiring a boot password upon execution of the boot loader will prevent an unauthorized user from entering boot parameters or changing the boot partition. This prevents users from weakening security (e.g. turning off SELinux at boot time)."
          solution    : "For newer grub2 based systems (Release 7.2 and newer):
Create an encrypted password with grub2-setpassword :

# grub2-setpassword

Enter password: <password>
Confirm password: <password>

OR
For older grub2 based systems:
create an encrypted password with grub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2:

# grub2-mkpasswd-pbkdf2

Enter password: <password>
Reenter password: <password>

Your PBKDF2 is <encrypted-password>

Add the following into /etc/grub.d/01_users or a custom /etc/grub.d configuration file:

cat <<EOF
set superusers='<username>'
password_pbkdf2 <username> <encrypted-password>
EOF

Run the following command to update the grub2 configuration:

# grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

Impact:

If password protection is enabled, only the designated superuser can edit a Grub 2 menu item by pressing 'e' or access the GRUB 2 command line by pressing 'c'

If GRUB 2 is set up to boot automatically to a password-protected menu entry the user has no option to back out of the password prompt to select another menu entry. Holding the SHIFT key will not display the menu in this case. The user must enter the correct username and password. If unable, the configuration files will have to be edited via the LiveCD or other means to fix the problem

You can add --unrestricted to the menu entries to allow the system to boot without entering a password. Password will still be required to edit menu items."

Assume this system was capable of routing packets to Internet routable addresses on one interface and private addresses on another interface. Assume that the private addresses were not routable to the Internet routable addresses and vice versa. Under normal routing circumstances, an attacker from the Internet routable addresses could not use the system as a way to reach the private address systems. If, however, source routed packets were allowed, they could be used to gain access to the private address systems as the route could be specified, rather than rely on routing protocols that did not allow this routing."

      info        : "When tcp_syncookies is set, the kernel will handle TCP SYN packets normally until the half-open connection queue is full, at which time, the SYN cookie functionality kicks in. SYN cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all. Instead, the kernel simply replies to the SYN with a SYN|ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake with the specially crafted sequence number. This allows the system to verify that it has received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no corresponding SYN in the queue.

Rationale:

SYN cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all. Instead, the kernel simply replies to the SYN with a SYN|ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake with the specially crafted sequence number. This allows the system to verify that it has received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no corresponding SYN in the queue.

Because of this NetworkManager tells firewalld to assign the network interface that is used for this connection to the zone defined in the configuration of that connection. This assignment happens before the interface is used. The configuration of the connection can either be the NetworkManager configuration or also an ifcfg. For example: If the zone is not set in the configuration file, the interfaces will be assigned to the default zone defined in the firewalld configuration. If a connection has more than one interface, all of them will be supplied to firewalld. Also changes in the names of interfaces will be handled by NetworkManager and supplied to firewalld.

Rationale:

A network interface not assigned to the appropriate zone can allow unexpected or undesired network traffic to be accepted on the interface.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

# firewall-cmd --zone=<Zone NAME> --change-interface=<INTERFACE NAME>

Example:

# firewall-cmd --zone=customezone --change-interface=eth0

Impact:

Changing firewall settings while connected over network can result in being locked out of the system.

Default Value:

If the zone is not set in the configuration file, the interfaces will be assigned to the default zone defined in the firewalld configuration

For every zone, you can set a default behavior that handles incoming traffic that is not further specified. Such behavior is defined by setting the target of the zone. There are three options - default, ACCEPT, REJECT, and DROP.

ACCEPT - you accept all incoming packets except those disabled by a specific rule.

REJECT - you disable all incoming packets except those that you have allowed in specific rules and the source machine is informed about the rejection.

DROP - you disable all incoming packets except those that you have allowed in specific rules and no information sent to the source machine.

Notes:

This recommendation assumes that recommendation 4.2.1.5, 'Ensure rsyslog is configured to send logs to a remote log host' has been implemented.

The main configuration file /etc/systemd/journald.conf is read before any of the custom *.conf files. If there are custom configs present, they override the main configuration parameters

As noted in the journald man pages: journald logs may be exported to rsyslog either through the process mentioned here, or through a facility like systemd-journald.service. There are trade-offs involved in each implementation, where ForwardToSyslog will immediately capture all events (and forward to an external log server, if properly configured), but may not capture all boot-up activities. Mechanisms such as systemd-journald.service, on the other hand, will record bootup events, but may delay sending the information to rsyslog, leading to the potential for log manipulation prior to export. Be aware of the limitations of all tools employed to secure a system.

Notes:

Some organizations may have stricter requirements for approved ciphers. Ensure that ciphers used are in compliance with site policy.

The only 'strong' ciphers currently FIPS 140-2 compliant are: aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr

CVE-2013-4548 referenced bellow applies to OpenSSH versions 6.2 and 6.3. If running these versions of Open SSH, Please upgrade to version 6.4 or later to fix the vulnerability, or disable AES-GCM in the server configuration.

The Following are the supported ciphers in openSSH:

3des-cbc

aes128-cbc

aes192-cbc

aes256-cbc

aes128-ctr

aes192-ctr

aes256-ctr

aes128-gcm@openssh.com

aes256-gcm@openssh.com

arcfour

arcfour128

arcfour256

blowfish-cbc

cast128-cbc

rijndael-cbc@lysator.liu.se

chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com




Rationale:

Weak ciphers that are used for authentication to the cryptographic module cannot be relied upon to provide confidentiality or integrity, and system data may be compromised.

The DES, Triple DES, and Blowfish ciphers, as used in SSH, have a birthday bound of approximately four billion blocks, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain cleartext data via a birthday attack against a long-duration encrypted session, aka a 'Sweet32' attack

The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, does not properly combine state data with key data during the initialization phase, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct plaintext-recovery attacks against the initial bytes of a stream by sniffing network traffic that occasionally relies on keys affected by the Invariance Weakness, and then using a brute-force approach involving LSB values, aka the 'Bar Mitzvah' issue

The passwords used during an SSH session encrypted with RC4 can be recovered by an attacker who is able to capture and replay the session

Error handling in the SSH protocol; Client and Server, when using a block cipher algorithm in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, makes it easier for remote attackers to recover certain plaintext data from an arbitrary block of ciphertext in an SSH session via unknown vectors

The mm_newkeys_from_blob function in monitor_wrap.c, when an AES-GCM cipher is used, does not properly initialize memory for a MAC context data structure, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended ForceCommand and login-shell restrictions via packet data that provides a crafted callback address"

The following options are set in the /etc/security/pwquality.conf file:

Password Length:

minlen = 14 - password must be 14 characters or more

Password complexity:

minclass = 4 - The minimum number of required classes of characters for the new password (digits, uppercase, lowercase, others)

OR

dcredit = -1 - provide at least one digit

ucredit = -1 - provide at least one uppercase character

ocredit = -1 - provide at least one special character

try_first_pass - retrieve the password from a previous stacked PAM module. If not available, then prompt the user for a password.

retry=3 - Allow 3 tries before sending back a failure.

The settings shown above are one possible policy. Alter these values to conform to your own organization's password policies.

Notes:

Additional module options may be set, recommendation only covers those listed here.

When modifying authentication configuration using the authconfig utility, the system-auth and password-auth files are overwritten with the settings from the authconfig utility. This can be avoided by creating symbolic links in place of the configuration files, which authconfig recognizes and does not overwrite.

Rationale:

The /etc/passwd file also contains information like user ID's and group ID's that are used by many system programs. Therefore, the /etc/passwd file must remain world readable. In spite of encoding the password with a randomly-generated one-way hash function, an attacker could still break the system if they got access to the /etc/passwd file. This can be mitigated by using shadowed passwords, thus moving the passwords in the /etc/passwd file to /etc/shadow. The /etc/shadow file is set so only root will be able to read and write. This helps mitigate the risk of an attacker gaining access to the encoded passwords with which to perform a dictionary attack.
