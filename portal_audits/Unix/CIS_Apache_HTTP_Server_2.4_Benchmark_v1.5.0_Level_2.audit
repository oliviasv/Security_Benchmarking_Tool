Just because a server can perform many services doesn't mean it is wise to do so. The number of services and daemons executing on the Apache Web server should be limited to those necessary, with the Web server being the only primary function of the server.

Rationale:

Maintaining a server for a single purpose increases the security of your application and system. The more services which are exposed to an attacker, the more potential vectors an attacker has to exploit the system and therefore the higher the risk for the server. A Web server should function as only a web server and if possible should not be mixed with other primary functions such as mail, DNS, database or middleware.

**Important Note**: There is a major difference between source builds and most vendor packages that is very important to highlight. The default source build of Apache is fairly conservative and minimalist in the modules included and therefore starts off in a fairly strong security state, while most vendor binaries are typically very well loaded with most of the functionality that one may be looking for. _**Therefore, it is important that you don't assume the default value shown in the benchmark will match default values in your installation.**_ You should always test any new installation in your environment before putting it into production. Also keep in mind you can install and run a new version alongside the old one by using a different Apache prefix and a different IP address or port number in the 'Listen' directive.

Rationale:

The benefits of using the vendor supplied binaries include:
- Ease of installation as it will just work, straight out of the box.
- It is customized for your OS environment.
- It will be tested and have gone through QA procedures.
- Everything you need is likely to be included, probably including some third-party modules. For example, many OS vendors ship Apache with 'mod_ssl' and OpenSSL, PHP, 'mod_perl,' and 'ModSecurity'.
- Your vendor will tell you about security issues so you have to look in fewer places.
- Updates to fix security issues will be easy to apply. The vendor will have already verified the problem, checked the signature on the Apache download, worked out the impact and so on.

Rationale:

Neither HTTP Basic nor HTTP Digest authentication should be used as the protocols are out dated and no longer considered secure. Disabling the modules will improve the security posture of the web server by reducing the amount of potentially vulnerable code paths exposed to the network and reducing potential for unauthorized access to files via misconfigured access controls.

In the early days of the web, Basic HTTP Authentication was considered adequate if it was only used over HTTPS, so that the credentials would not be sent in the clear. Basic authentication uses Base64 to encode the credentials which are sent with every request. Base64 encoding is of course easily reversed, and is no more secure than clear text. The issues with using Basic Auth over HTTPS is that it does not meet current security standards for protecting the login credentials and protecting the authenticated
session. The following security issues plague the Basic Authentication protocol.

- The authenticated session has an indefinite length (as long as any browser window is open) and is not timed-out on the server when the session is idle.

- Application logout is required to invalidate the session on the server to limit, but in the case of Basic Authentication, there is no server-side session that can be invalidated.

- The credentials are remembered by the browser and stored in memory.

- There is no way to disable auto-complete, where the browser offers to store the passwords.
Passwords stored in the browser can be accessed if the client system or browser become
compromised.

- The credentials are more likely to be exposed since they are automatically sent with every
request.

- Administrators may at times have access to the HTTP headers sent in request for the purposes of diagnosing problems and detecting attacks. Having a user's credentials in the clear in the HTTP headers, may allow a user to repudiate actions performed, because the web or system
administrators also had access to the user's password.

Typically, system accounts numbers range from '1-999', or '1-499' and are defined in the '/etc/login.defs' file.

As an even more secure alternative, if the Apache web server can be run on high unprivileged ports, then it is not necessary to start Apache as 'root', and all of the Apache processes may be run as the Apache specific user as described below."

      description : "3.13 Ensure Access to Special Purpose Application Writable Directories is Properly Restricted"
      info        : "When the Apache webserver includes application software such as PHP, Java and many others, it is common for the application to require a writable directory. The writable directory may be needed for file uploads, application data, user session state information or many other purposes. It is important such directories have a single purpose, and have access properly secured to prevent a variety of possible exploits. The directory should be:

 - Single Purpose Directory
 - Outside the Configured Web DocumentRoot
 - Owned by the root User or an Administrator Account
 - Not writable by Other

Rationale:

The following provides the rationale for each requirement on the application writable directory:

- **Single Purpose Directory** - Each writable application directory should have a single purpose. For example, mixing file uploads in the same directory with session tracking information would be an obvious vulnerability, as users could create session information, to hijack or manufacturer authenticated sessions.

- **Outside the Configured Web DocumentRoot** - The directory should NOT be under the configured DocumentRoot directory as such directories are browsable by default, and might allow unintentional web read access. With web read access an attacker could upload malicious content, and then references the content in a URL exploiting the trust that users have in the website.

- **Owned by the root User or an Administrator Account** - The directory should be owned by root or a designated administrator to prevent unintended changes to the permissions.

- **Not Writable by Other** - The write access can be provided through the group permissions to the configured Apache group rather than allow write access to Other / all users. The group write access should implement the least privileges necessary in order prevent unintended access to the directory. If the application requires more complex write access, such as to specific accounts or for multiple groups, usage of an access control lists (ACL) is recommended. ACL's are supported by most Linux file systems, and can be enabled when the file system is mounted.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
      solution    : "Perform the following:

1. **Single Purpose Directory** - Create separate directories of the multipurpose directory, and adjust the application configuration and directory ownership and permissions appropriately.

2. **Outside the Configured Web DocumentRoot** - Move the writable directory to a more suitable location NOT under the DocumentRoot directory. A location within the /var/ filesystem may be a good choice for changeable data.

3. **Owned by the root User or an Administrator Account** - Change the ownership to root or an administrator.

 chown root $WR_DIR

4. **Not writable by Other** - Remove the other write permissions, use group write or ACLs to provide the least privileges necessary.

Rationale:

Likewise, the options for other directories and hosts needs to be restricted to the minimal options required. A setting of 'None' is recommended, however it is recognized that other options may be needed in some cases:

- 'Multiviews' - Is appropriate if content negotiation is required, such as when multiple languages are supported.
- 'ExecCGI' - Is only appropriate for special directories dedicated to executable content such as a 'cgi-bin/' directory. That way you will know what is executed on the server. It is possible to enable CGI script execution based on file extension or permission settings, however this makes script control and management almost impossible as developers may install scripts without your knowledge. This may become a factor in a hosting environment.
- 'FollowSymLinks' & 'SymLinksIfOwnerMatch' - The following of symbolic links is not recommended and should be disabled if possible. The usage of symbolic links opens up additional risk for possible attacks that may use inappropriate symbolic links to access content outside of the document root of the web server. Also consider that it could be combined with a vulnerability that allowed an attacker or insider to create an inappropriate link. The option 'SymLinksIfOwnerMatch' is much safer in that the ownership must match in order for the link to be used, however keep in mind there is additional overhead created by requiring Apache to check the ownership.
- 'Includes' & 'IncludesNOEXEC' - The 'IncludesNOEXEC' option should only be needed when server side includes are required. The full 'Includes' option should not be used as it also allows execution of arbitrary shell commands. See Apache Mod Include for details [https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod\_include.html](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_include.html)

      info        : "Use the Apache '*' directive to restrict unnecessary HTTP request methods of the web server to only accept and process the 'GET', 'HEAD', 'POST' and 'OPTIONS' HTTP request methods.

Rationale:

The HTTP 1.1 protocol supports several request methods which are rarely used and potentially high risk. For example, methods such as 'PUT' and 'DELETE' are rarely used and should be disabled in keeping with the primary security principal of minimize features and options. Also since the usage of these methods is typically to modify resources on the web server, they should be explicitly disallowed. For normal web server operation, you will typically need to allow only the 'GET', 'HEAD' and 'POST' request methods. This will allow for downloading of web pages and submitting information to web forms. The 'OPTIONS' request method will also be allowed as it used to request which HTTP request methods are allowed. Unfortunately, the Apache '*' directive does not deny the 'TRACE' request method. The 'TRACE' request method will be disallowed in another benchmark recommendation with the 'TraceEnable' directive."

      info        : "Restrict access to inappropriate file extensions that are not expected to be a legitimate part of web sites using the 'FilesMatch' directive.

Rationale:

There are many files that are often left within the web server document root that could provide an attacker with sensitive information. Most often these files are mistakenly left behind after installation, trouble-shooting, or backing up files before editing. Regardless of the reason for their creation, these files can still be served by Apache even when there is no hyperlink pointing to them. The web administrators should use the 'FilesMatch' directive to restrict access to only those file extensions that are appropriate for the web server. Rather than create a list of potentially inappropriate file extensions such as '.bak', '.config', '.old', etc, it is recommended instead that a white list of the appropriate and expected file extensions for the web server be created, reviewed and restricted with a 'FilesMatch' directive."

1. Compile a list of existing file extension on the web server. The following 'find/awk' command may be useful, but is likely to need some customization according to the appropriate webroot directories for your web server. Please note that the find command skips over any files without a dot (.) in the file name, as these are not expected to be appropriate web content.

 find */htdocs -type f -name '*.*' | awk -F. '{print $NF }' | sort -u

2. Review the list of existing file extensions, for appropriate content for the web server, remove those that are inappropriate and add any additional file extensions expected to be added to the web server in the near future.
3. Add the 'FilesMatch' directive below which denies access to all files by default.

 # Block all files by default, unless specifically allowed.

The server error logs are invaluable because they can also be used to spot any potential problems before they become serious. Most importantly, they can be used to watch for anomalous behavior such as a lot of 'not found' or 'unauthorized' errors may be an indication that an attack is pending or has occurred.

It enables but does not include a powerful customizable rule set, which may be used to detect and block common web application attacks. Installation of ModSecurity without a rule set does not provide additional security for the protected web applications. Refer to the benchmark recommendation '_Install and Enable OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set_' for details on a recommended rule set.

**Note:** Like other application security/application firewall systems, ModSecurity requires a significant commitment of staff resources for initial tuning of the rules and handling alerts. In some cases, this may require additional time working with application developers/maintainers to modify applications based on analysis of the results of tuning and monitoring logs. After setup, an ongoing commitment of staff is required for monitoring logs and ongoing tuning, especially after upgrades/patches. Without this commitment to tuning and monitoring, installing ModSecurity may NOT be effective and may provide a false sense of security.

          info        : "The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rules Set (CRS) is a set of open source web application defensive rules for the ModSecurity web application firewall (WAF). The OWASP ModSecurity CRS provides baseline protections in the following attack/threat categories:

- HTTP Protection - detecting violations of the HTTP protocol and a locally defined usage policy.
- Real-time Blacklist Lookups - utilizes 3rd Party IP Reputation
- HTTP Denial of Service Protections - defense against HTTP Flooding and Slow HTTP DoS Attacks.
- Common Web Attacks Protection - detecting common web application security attack.
- Automation Detection - detecting bots, crawlers, scanners and other surface malicious activity.
- Integration with AV Scanning for File Uploads - detects malicious files uploaded through the web application.
- Tracking Sensitive Data - tracks credit card usage and blocks leakages.
- Trojan Protection - detecting access to trojan horses.
- Identification of Application Defects - alerts on application misconfigurations.
- Error Detection and Hiding - disguising error messages sent by the server.

**Note:** Like other application security/application firewall systems, ModSecurity requires a significant commitment of staff resources for initial tuning of the rules and handling alerts. In some cases, this may require additional time working with application developers/maintainers to modify applications based on analysis of the results of tuning and monitoring logs. After setup, an ongoing commitment of staff is required for monitoring logs and ongoing tuning, especially after upgrades/patches. Without this commitment to tuning and monitoring, installing ModSecurity may NOT be effective and may provide a false sense of security.

Installing, configuring and enabling of the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS), provides additional baseline security defense, and provides a good starting point to customize the monitoring and blocking of common web application attacks."

      info        : "The default SSL certificate is self-signed and is not trusted. Install a valid certificate signed by a commonly trusted certificate authority. To be valid, the certificate must be:
- Signed by a trusted certificate authority
- Not be expired, and
- Have a common name that matches the host name of the web server, such as www.example.com.

**Note:** Some previously 'Trusted' Certificate Authority certificates had been signed with a weak hash algorithm such as MD5, or SHA1. These signature algorithms are known to be vulnerable to collision attacks. Note that it's not the just the signature on the server's certificate, but any signature up the certificate chain. Such CA certificates are considered no longer trusted as of January 1, 2017.

Rationale:

A digital certificate on your server automatically communicates your site's authenticity to visitors' web browsers. If a trusted authority signs your certificate, it confirms for the visitor they are actually communicating with you, and not with a fraudulent site stealing credit card numbers or personal information."
      solution    : "Perform the following to implement the recommended state:
1. Decide on the host name to be used for the certificate. It is important to remember that the browser will compare the host name in the URL to the common name in the certificate, so that it is important that all https: URL's match the correct host name. Specifically, the host name 'www.example.com' is not the same as 'example.com' nor the same as 'ssl.example.com'.
2. Generate a private key using openssl. Although certificate key lengths of 1024 have been common in the past, a key length of 2048 is now recommended for strong authentication. The key must be kept confidential and will be encrypted with a passphrase by default. Follow the steps below and respond to the prompts for a passphrase. See the Apache or OpenSSL documentation for details:

3. Create a certificate specific template configuration file. It is important that common name in the certificate exactly make the web host name in the intended URL. If there are multiple host names which may be used, as is very common, then the 'subjectAltName' (SAN) field should be filled with all of the alternate names. Creating a template configuration file specific to the server certificate is helpful, as it allows for multiple entries in the 'subjectAltName'. Also, any typos in the CSR can be potentially costly due to the lost time, so using a file, rather than hand typing helps prevent errors. To create a template configuration file, make a local copy of the 'openssl.cnf' typically found in '/etc/ssl/' or '/etc/pki/tls/'

 # cp /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf ex1.cnf>

4. Find the request section which follows the line '[ req ]. Then add or modify the configuration file to include the appropriate values for the host names. It is recommended (but not required) that the first 'subjectAltName' match the 'commonName'.

 [ req ]
 . . .
 distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
 req_extensions = req_ext

 [ req_ext ]
 subjectAltName = @alt_names

 [alt_names]
 DNS.1 = www.example.com
 DNS.2 = example.com
 DNS.3 = app.example.com
 DNS.4 = service.example.com

5. Continue editing the configuration file under the request distinguished name section to change the existing default values in the configuration file to match the desired certificates information.

 [ req_distinguished_name ]
 countryName_default = GB
 stateOrProvinceName_default = Scotland
 localityName_default = Glasgow
 0.organizationName_default = Example Company Ltd
 organizationalUnitName_default = ICT
 commonName_default = www.example.com

6. Now generate the CSR from the template file, verifying the information. If the default values were placed in the template, then just press enter to confirm the default value.

 # openssl req -new -config ex2.cnf -out example.com.csr -key example.com.key
 Enter pass phrase for example.com.key:
 You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
 into your certificate request.
 What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.

 Locality Name (eg, city) [Glasgow]:
 Organization Name (eg, company) [Example Company Ltd]:

 . . .

8. Now move the private key to its intended directory.

 # mv www.example.com.key /etc/ssl/private/

9. Send the certificate signing request (CSR) to a certificate signing authority to be signed, and follow their instructions for submission and validation. The CSR and the final signed certificate are just encoded text and need to be protected for integrity, but not confidentiality. This certificate will be given out for every SSL connection made.
10. The resulting signed certificate may be named 'www.example.com.crt' and placed in '/etc/ssl/certs/' as readable by all (mode '0444'). Please note that the certificate authority does not need the private key ('example.com.key') and this file must be carefully protected. With a decrypted copy of the private key, it would be possible to decrypt all conversations with the server.
11. Do not forget the passphrase used to encrypt the private key. It will be required every time the server is started in https mode. If it is necessary to avoid requiring an administrator having to type the passphrase every time the 'httpd' service is started, the private key may be stored in clear text. Storing the private key in clear text increases the convenience while increasing the risk of disclosure of the key, but may be appropriate for the sake of being able to restart, if the risks are well managed. Be sure that the key file is only readable by root. To decrypt the private key and store it in clear text file the following openssl command may be used. You can tell by the private key headers whether it is encrypted or clear text.

 # cd /etc/ssl/private/
 # umask 077
 # openssl rsa -in www.example.com.key -out www.example.com.key.clear

12. Locate the Apache configuration file for 'mod_ssl' and add or modify the 'SSLCertificateFile' and 'SSLCertificateKeyFile'directives to have the correct path for the private key and signed certificate files. If a clear text key is referenced then a passphrase will not be required. You may need to configure the CA's certificate along with any intermediate CA certificates that signed your certificate using the 'SSLCertificateChainFile' directive. As an alternative, starting with Apache version 2.4.8 the CA and intermediate certificates may be concatenated to the server certificate configured with the 'SSLCertificateFile' directive instead.

 SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/example.com.crt
 SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/example.com.key
 # Default CA file, can be replaced with your CA certificate.
 SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/ssl/certs/server-chain.crt

13. Lastly, start or restart the 'httpd' service and verify correct functioning with your favorite browser."

The 'SSLCipherSuite' directive specifies which ciphers are allowed in the negotiation with the client. While the 'SSLHonorCipherOrder' causes the server's preferred ciphers to be used instead of the clients' specified preferences.

Rationale:

The SSL/TLS protocols support a large number of encryption ciphers including many weak ciphers that are subject to man-in-the middle attacks and information disclosure. Some implementations even support the NULL cipher which allows a TLS connection without any encryption! Therefore, it is critical to ensure the configuration only allows strong ciphers greater than or equal to 128-bit to be negotiated with the client. Stronger 256-bit ciphers should be allowed and preferred. In addition, enabling the 'SSLHonorCipherOrder' further protects the client from man-in-the-middle downgrade attacks by ensuring the server's preferred ciphers will be used rather than the clients' preferences.

In addition, the RC4 stream ciphers should be disabled, even though they are widely used and have been recommended in previous Apache benchmarks as a means of mitigating attacks based on CBC cipher vulnerabilities. The RC4 ciphers have known cryptographic weaknesses and are no longer recommended. The IETF has published RFC 7465 standard [2] that would disallow RC4 negotiation for all TLS versions. While the document is somewhat new (Feb 2015) it is expected the RC4 cipher suites will begin to disappear from options in TLS deployments.

The TLSv1.0 protocol is vulnerable to the BEAST attack when used in CBC mode (October 2011).

Rationale:

Usage of HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) helps protect HSTS compliant browsers and other agents from HTTP downgrade attacks. Downgrade attacks include a variety of man-in-the-middle attacks which leave the web communication vulnerable to disclosure and modification by forcing the usage of HTTP rather than HTTPS communication. The 'sslstrip' attack tool by Moxie Marlinspike released in 2009 is one such attack, which works when the server allows both HTTP and HTTPS communication. However, a man-in-the-middle HTTP-to-HTTPS proxy would be effective in cases where the server required HTTPS, but did not publish an HSTS policy to the browser. This attack would also be effective on browsers which were not compliant with HSTS. All current up-to-date browsers support HSTS.

The HSTS header specifies a length of time in seconds that the browser / user agent should access the server only using HTTPS. The header may also specify if all sub-domains should also be included in the same policy. Once a compliant browser receives the HSTS Header it will not allow access to the server via HTTP. Therefore, it is important that you ensure that there is no portion of the web site or web application that requires HTTP prior to enabling the HSTS protocol.

If all sub-domains are to be included via the _includeSubDomains_ option, then carefully consider all various host names, web applications and third-party services used to include any DNS CNAME values that may be impacted. An overly broad _includeSubDomains_ policy will disable access to HTTP web sites for all websites with the same domain name. Also consider that the access will be disabled for the number of seconds given in the max-age value, so in the event a mistake is made, a large value, such as a year, could create significant support issues. An optional flag of preload may be added if the web site name is to be submitted to be preloaded in Chrome, Firefox and Safari browsers.

If an attacker can accurately target their exploits, the chances of successful compromise prior to detection increase dramatically. Script Kiddies are constantly scanning the Internet and documenting the version information openly provided by web servers. The purpose of this scanning is to accumulate a database of software installed on those hosts, which can then be used when new vulnerabilities are released."

DoS attacks, which are normally applied to the network layer, are also possible at the application layer. These malicious attacks can succeed by starving a system of critical resources, vulnerability exploit, or abuse of functionality.

By decreasing the timeout for old connections and we allow the server to free up resources more quickly and be more responsive.

Rationale:

With the proper implementation of SELinux, vulnerabilities in the web application may be prevented from being exploited due to the additional restrictions. For example, a vulnerability that allows an attacker to read inappropriate system files may be prevented from execution by SELinux because the inappropriate files are not labeled as 'httpd_sys_content_t'. Likewise writing to an unexpected directory or execution of unexpected content can be prevented by similar mandatory security labels enforced by SELinux."

There are over a hundred individual httpd related types defined in a default Apache SELinux policy which includes many of the common Apache add-ons and applications such as php, nagios, smokeping and many others.

- 'http_port_t' - Network ports allowed for listening
- 'httpd_sys_content_t' - Read access to directories and files with web content
- 'httpd_log_t' - Directories and files to be used for writable log data

However thorough testing, review and customization will be necessary to ensure that the Apache profile restrictions allow necessary functionality while implementing least privilege.

Rationale:

With the proper implementation of AppArmor profile, vulnerabilities in the web application may be prevented from being exploited due to the additional restrictions. For example, a vulnerability that allows an attacker to read an inappropriate system files may be prevented from execution by AppArmor because the inappropriate files are not allowed by the profile.

3. Set the apache2 profile in complain mode so that access violations will be allowed and logged.

 # aa-complain apache2
 Setting /usr/sbin/apache2 to complain mode.

4. Start the apache2 service

 # service apache2 start

5. Thoroughly test the web application attempting to exercise all intended functionality so that AppArmor will generate the necessary logs of all resources accessed. The logs are sent via the system syslog utility and are typically found in either the '/var/log/syslog' or '/var/log/messages' files. Also stop and restart the web server as part of the testing process.
6. Use 'aa-logprof' to update the profile based on logs generated during the testing. The tool will prompt for suggested modifications to the profile, based on the logs. The logs may also be reviewed manually in order to update the profile.

 # aa-logprof

7. Review and edit the profile, removing any inappropriate content, and adding appropriate access rules. Directories with multiple files accessed with the same permission can be simplified with the usage of wild-cards when appropriate. Reload the updated profile using the 'apparmor_parser' command.
