      description : "1.3 Ensure Apache Is Installed From the Appropriate Binaries"
      info        : "The CIS Apache Benchmark recommends using the Apache binary provided by your vendor for most situations in order to reduce the effort and increase the effectiveness of maintenance and security patches. However, to keep the benchmark as generic and applicable to all Unix/Linux platforms as possible, a default source build has been used for this benchmark.

**Important Note**: There is a major difference between source builds and most vendor packages that is very important to highlight. The default source build of Apache is fairly conservative and minimalist in the modules included, and therefore starts off in a fairly strong security state, while most vendor binaries are typically very well loaded with most of the functionality that one may be looking for. _**Therefore, it is important that you don't assume the default value shown in the benchmark will match default values in your installation.**_ You should always test any new installation in your environment before putting it into production. Also, keep in mind you can install and run a new version alongside the old one by using a different Apache prefix and a different IP address or port number in the 'Listen' directive.

Rationale:

The benefits of using vendor supplied binaries include:
- Easy installation; it should work straight out of the box.
- It is customized for your OS environment.
- It has been tested and gone through QA procedures.
- Everything you need is likely to be included, probably including some third-party modules. Many OS vendors ship Apache with 'mod_ssl', OpenSSL, PHP, 'mod_perl' and 'mod_security', for example.
- Your vendor will tell you about security issues, so you have to look for information in fewer places.
- Updates to fix security issues will be easy to apply. The vendor will have already verified the problem, checked the signature on the Apache download, worked out the impact, and so on.
- You may be able to get the updates automatically, reducing the window of risk.

Rationale:

Neither HTTP Basic nor HTTP Digest authentication should be used as the protocols are out dated and no longer considered secure. Disabling the modules will improve the security posture of the web server by reducing the amount of potentially vulnerable code paths exposed to the network and reducing potential for unauthorized access to files via misconfigured access controls.

In the early days of the web, Basic HTTP Authentication was considered adequate if it was only used over HTTPS, so that the credentials would not be sent in the clear. Basic authentication uses Base64 to encode the credentials which are sent with every request. Base64 encoding is of course easily reversed, and is no more secure than clear text. The issues with using Basic Auth over HTTPS is that it does not meet current security standards for protecting the login credentials and protecting the authenticated
session. The following security issues plague the Basic Authentication protocol.

- The authenticated session has an indefinite length (as long as any browser window is open) and is not timed-out on the server when the session is idle.

- Application logout is required to invalidate the session on the server to limit, but in the case of Basic Authentication, there is no server-side session that can be invalidated.

- The credentials are remembered by the browser and stored in memory.

- There is no way to disable auto-complete, where the browser offers to store the passwords.
Passwords stored in the browser can be accessed if the client system or browser become
compromised.

- The credentials are more likely to be exposed since they are automatically sent with every
request.

- Administrators may at times have access to the HTTP headers sent in request for the purposes of diagnosing problems and detecting attacks. Having a user's credentials in the clear in the HTTP headers, may allow a user to repudiate actions performed, because the web or system
administrators also had access to the user's password.

On most Linux platforms, shared memory will be used instead of a file in the file system, so this directive is not generally needed and does not need to be specified. However, if the directive is specified, Apache will use the configured file for IPC, so it needs to be located in a secure directory.

Rationale:

If the 'ScoreBoardFile' is placed in a writable directory, other accounts could create a denial of service attack and prevent the server from starting by creating a file with the same name, and users could monitor and disrupt communication between the processes by reading and writing to the file."

1. Check to see if the 'ScoreBoardFile' is specified in any of the Apache configuration files. If it is not present, no changes are required.

3. Modify the directory if it is within the Apache 'DocumentRoot' or if it is on an NFS mounted file system and not a locally mounted hard drive.

      description : "3.13 Ensure Access to Special Purpose Application Writable Directories is Properly Restricted"
      info        : "When the Apache webserver includes application software such as PHP, Java and many others, it is common for the application to require a writable directory. The writable directory may be needed for file uploads, application data, user session state information or many other purposes. It is important such directories have a single purpose, and have access properly secured to prevent a variety of possible exploits. The directory should be:

 - Single Purpose Directory
 - Outside the Configured Web DocumentRoot
 - Owned by the root User or an Administrator Account
 - Not writable by Other

Rationale:

The following provides the rationale for each requirement on the application writable directory:

- **Single Purpose Directory** - Each writable application directory should have a single purpose. For example, mixing file uploads in the same directory with session tracking information would be an obvious vulnerability, as users could create session information, to hijack or manufacturer authenticated sessions.

- **Outside the Configured Web DocumentRoot** - The directory should NOT be under the configured DocumentRoot directory as such directories are browsable by default, and might allow unintentional web read access. With web read access an attacker could upload malicious content, and then references the content in a URL exploiting the trust that users have in the website.

- **Owned by the root User or an Administrator Account** - The directory should be owned by root or a designated administrator to prevent unintended changes to the permissions.

- **Not Writable by Other** - The write access can be provided through the group permissions to the configured Apache group rather than allow write access to Other / all users. The group write access should implement the least privileges necessary in order prevent unintended access to the directory. If the application requires more complex write access, such as to specific accounts or for multiple groups, usage of an access control lists (ACL) is recommended. ACL's are supported by most Linux file systems, and can be enabled when the file system is mounted.

NOTE: Nessus has not performed this check. Please review the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
      solution    : "Perform the following:

1. **Single Purpose Directory** - Create separate directories of the multipurpose directory, and adjust the application configuration and directory ownership and permissions appropriately.

2. **Outside the Configured Web DocumentRoot** - Move the writable directory to a more suitable location NOT under the DocumentRoot directory. A location within the /var/ filesystem may be a good choice for changeable data.

3. **Owned by the root User or an Administrator Account** - Change the ownership to root or an administrator.

 chown root $WR_DIR

4. **Not writable by Other** - Remove the other write permissions, use group write or ACLs to provide the least privileges necessary.

Refer to the Apache 2.2 documentation for details

Rationale:

The options for other directories and hosts should be restricted to the minimal options required. A setting of 'None' is recommended; however, it is recognized that other options may be needed in some cases:
- 'Multiviews' is appropriate if content negotiation is required, such as when multiple languages are supported.
- 'ExecCGI' is only appropriate for special directories dedicated to executable content, such as a 'cgi-bin/' directory. That way you will know what is executed on the server. It is possible to enable CGI script execution based on file extension or permission settings, but this makes script control and management almost impossible as developers may install scripts without your knowledge.
- 'FollowSymLinks' & 'SymLinksIfOwnerMatch': The following of symbolic links is not recommended and should be disabled if possible. The usage of symbolic links opens up additional risk for possible attacks that may use inappropriate symbolic links to access content outside of the document root of the web server. Also consider that it could be combined with a vulnerability that allows an attacker or insider to create an inappropriate link. The option 'SymLinksIfOwnerMatch' is much safer in that the ownership must match in order for the link to be used, but keep in mind there is additional overhead created by requiring Apache to check the ownership.
- 'Includes' & 'IncludesNOEXEC': The 'IncludesNOEXEC' option should only be needed when server side includes are required. The full 'Includes' option should not be used because it allows execution of arbitrary shell commands. See Apache Mod Include for details [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_include.html](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_include.html).

The log level values are the standard syslog levels of 'emerg', 'alert', 'crit', 'error', 'warn', 'notice', 'info' and 'debug'.

Rationale:

The server error logs are invaluable because they can be used to spot potential problems before they become serious. Most importantly, they can be used to watch for anomalous behavior such as numerous 'not found' or 'unauthorized' errors that may be an indication an attack is pending or has occurred.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**

The Apache htttpd server stopped including '404 not found' errors in its error log several years ago. Not including the 404 errors may cause log monitoring and host intrusion detection and prevention software to miss web scanning attacks which cause a large number of 'not found' errors, and may fail to block the attack. For Apache 2.4 benchmark we have recommended using ''notice core:info'' in order to pick up the 404 errors. However, in Apache 2.2, the 'LogLevel' directive doesn't support multiple levels. So the same recommended solution is not available. There are three alternatives to consider:
1. Set the 'LogLevel' to info - However this may create excessive logs, especially for TLS connections. The excessive logs may overwhelm the log monitoring processes.
2. Adapt the log monitoring and IDS to monitor the access logs. Which are much more frequent and may also overwhelm the log monitoring system.
3. Upgrade to Apache 2.4.

      info        : "Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) was developed by Netscape and turned into an open standard and was renamed Transport Layer Security (TLS) as part of the process. TLS is important for protecting communication and can provide authentication of the server and even the client. However, contrary to vendor claims, implementing SSL does NOT directly make your web server more secure! SSL is used to encrypt traffic and therefore does provide confidentiality of private information and users credentials. Keep in mind, however that just because you have encrypted the data in transit does not mean that the data provided by the client is secure while it is on the server. Also, SSL does not protect the web server, as attackers will easily target SSL-Enabled web servers, and the attack will be hidden in the encrypted channel.

The 'mod_ssl' module is the standard, most used module that implements SSL/TLS for Apache. A newer module found on Red Hat systems can be a compliment or replacement for 'mod_ssl' and provides the same functionality plus additional security services. The 'mod_nss' is an Apache module implementation of the Network Security Services (NSS) software from Mozilla, which implements a wide range of cryptographic functions in addition to TLS.

Rationale:

It is best to plan for SSL/TLS implementation from the beginning of any new web server because most web servers have some need for SSL/TLS due to:
- Non-public information submitted that should be protected as it's transmitted to the web server
- Non-public information that is downloaded from the web server
- Users authenticating to some portion of the web server
- Authenticating the web server to ensure users they have reached the real web server and have not been phished or redirected to a bogus site"

      info        : "The default SSL certificate is self-signed and is not trusted. Install a valid certificate signed by a commonly trusted certificate authority. To be valid, the certificate must be:
- Signed by a trusted certificate authority
- Not be expired, and
- Have a common name that matches the host name of the web server, such as www.example.com.

**Note:** Some previously 'Trusted' Certificate Authority certificates had been signed with a weak hash algorithm such as MD5, or SHA1. These signature algorithms are known to be vulnerable to collision attacks. Note that it's not the just the signature on the server's certificate, but any signature up the certificate chain. Such CA certificates are considered no longer trusted as of January 1, 2017.

Rationale:

A digital certificate on your server automatically communicates your site's authenticity to visitors' web browsers. If a trusted authority signs your certificate, it confirms for visitors they are actually communicating with you, and not with a fraudulent site stealing credit card numbers or personal information."
      solution    : "Perform the following to implement the recommended state:

1. Decide on the hostname to be used for the certificate. It is important to remember that the browser will compare the hostname in the URL to the common name in the certificate, so it is important that all https: URLs match the correct hostname. Specifically, the hostname 'www.example.com' is not the same as 'example.com' nor the same as 'ssl.example.com'.
2. Generate a private key using openssl. Although certificate key lengths of 1024 have been common in the past, a key length of 2048 is now recommended for strong authentication. The key must be kept confidential and will be encrypted with a passphrase by default. Follow the steps below and respond to the prompts for a passphrase. See the Apache or OpenSSL documentation for details:

3. Create a certificate specific template configuration file. It is important that common name in the certificate exactly make the web host name in the intended URL. If there are multiple host names which may be used, as is very common, then the 'subjectAltName' (SAN) field should be filled with all of the alternate names. Creating a template configuration file specific to the server certificate is helpful, as it allows for multiple entries in the 'subjectAltName'. Also, any typos in the CSR can be potentially costly due to the lost time, so using a file, rather than hand typing helps prevent errors. To create a template configuration file, make a local copy of the 'openssl.cnf' typically found in '/etc/ssl/' or '/etc/pki/tls/'

 # cp /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf ex1.cnf>

4. Find the request section which follows the line ''[ req ] ''. Then add or modify the configuration file to include the appropriate values for the host names. It is recommended (but not required) that the first 'subjectAltName' match the 'commonName'.

 [ req ]
 . . .
 distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
 req_extensions = req_ext

 [ req_ext ]
 subjectAltName = @alt_names

 [alt_names]
 DNS.1 = www.example.com
 DNS.2 = example.com
 DNS.3 = app.example.com
 DNS.4 = service.example.com

5. Continue editing the configuration file under the request distinguished name section to change the existing default values in the configuration file to match the desired certificates information.

 [ req_distinguished_name ]
 countryName_default = GB
 stateOrProvinceName_default = Scotland
 localityName_default = Glasgow
 0.organizationName_default = Example Company Ltd
 organizationalUnitName_default = ICT
 commonName_default = www.example.com

6. Now generate the CSR from the template file, verifying the information. If the default values were placed in the template, then just press enter to confirm the default value.

 # openssl req -new -config ex2.cnf -out example.com.csr -key example.com.key
 Enter pass phrase for example.com.key:
 You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated

 Organization Name (eg, company) [Example Company Ltd]:

 . . .

8. Now move the private key to its intended directory.

 # mv www.example.com.key /etc/ssl/private/

9. Send the certificate signing request (CSR) to a certificate signing authority to be signed, and follow their instructions for submission and validation. The CSR and the final signed certificate are just encoded text and need to be protected for integrity, but not confidentiality. This certificate will be given out for every SSL connection made.
10. The resulting signed certificate may be named 'www.example.com.crt' and placed in '/etc/ssl/certs/' as readable by all (mode '0444'). Please note that the certificate authority does not need the private key ('example.com.key') and this file must be carefully protected. With a decrypted copy of the private key, it would be possible to decrypt all conversations with the server.
11. Do not forget the passphrase used to encrypt the private key. It will be required every time the server is started in https mode. If it is necessary to avoid requiring an administrator having to type the passphrase every time the 'httpd' service is started, the private key may be stored in clear text. Storing the private key in clear text increases the convenience while increasing the risk of disclosure of the key, but may be appropriate for the sake of being able to restart, if the risks are well managed. Be sure that the key file is only readable by root. To decrypt the private key and store it in clear text file the following openssl command may be used. You can tell by the private key headers whether it is encrypted or clear text.

 # cd /etc/ssl/private/
 # umask 077
 # openssl rsa -in www.example.com.key -out www.example.com.key.clear

12. Locate the Apache configuration file for 'mod_ssl' and add or modify the 'SSLCertificateFile' and 'SSLCertificateKeyFile'directives to have the correct path for the private key and signed certificate files. If a clear text key is referenced then a passphrase will not be required. You may need to configure the CA's certificate along with any intermediate CA certificates that signed your certificate using the 'SSLCertificateChainFile' directive. As an alternative, starting with Apache version 2.4.8 the CA and intermediate certificates may be concatenated to the server certificate configured with the 'SSLCertificateFile' directive instead.

 SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/example.com.crt
 SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/example.com.key
 # Default CA file, can be replaced with your CA certificate.
 SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/ssl/certs/server-chain.crt

13. Lastly, start or restart the 'httpd' service and verify correct functioning with your favorite browser."

The 'SSLCipherSuite' directive specifies which ciphers are allowed in the negotiation with the client. The 'SSLHonorCipherOrder' directive causes the server's preferred ciphers to be used instead of the clients' specified preferences.

Rationale:

The SSL/TLS protocols support a large number of encryption ciphers, including many weak ciphers that are subject to man-in-the middle attacks and information disclosure. Some implementations even support the NULL cipher, which allows a TLS connection without any encryption! Therefore, it is critical to ensure the configuration only allows strong ciphers greater than or equal to 128 bit to be negotiated with the client. Stronger 256-bit ciphers should be allowed and preferred. In addition, enabling 'SSLHonorCipherOrder' further protects the client from man-in-the-middle downgrade attacks by ensuring the server's preferred ciphers will be used rather than the clients' preferences.

In addition, the RC4 stream ciphers should be disabled, even though they are widely used and have been recommended in previous Apache benchmarks as a means of mitigating attacks based on CBC cipher vulnerabilities. The RC4 ciphers have known cryptographic weaknesses and are no longer recommended. The IETF has published the RFC 7465 standard[4] that would disallow RC4 negotiation for all TLS versions. While the document is somewhat new (Feb 2015), it is expected the RC4 cipher suites will begin to disappear from options in TLS deployments. In the meantime, it is important to ensure that RC4-based cipher suites are disabled in the configuration."

Ensure the 'SSLCipherSuite' includes all of the following:

'!NULL:!SSLv2:!RC4:!aNULL' values. For example, add or modify the following line in the Apache server level configuration and every virtual host that is TLS enabled:

SSLHonorCipherOrder On
SSLCipherSuite ALL:!EXP:!NULL:!LOW:!SSLv2:!RC4:!aNULL

It is **not** recommended to add '!SSLv3' to the directive even if the SSLv3 protocol is not in use. Doing so disables ALL of the ciphers that may used with SSLv3, which includes the same ciphers used with the TLS protocols. The !aNULL will disable both the ADH and AECDH ciphers, so the !ADH is not required.

      info        : "Disable weak SSL ciphers using the 'SSLCipherSuite' and 'SSLHonorCipherOrder' directives. The 'SSLCipherSuite' directive specifies which ciphers are allowed in the negotiation with the client. The 'SSLHonorCipherOrder' directive causes the server's preferred ciphers to be used instead of the clients' specified preferences.

Rationale:

The SSL/TLS protocols support a large number of encryption ciphers, including many weak ciphers that are subject to man-in-the middle attacks and information disclosure. Some implementations even support the NULL cipher, which allows a TLS connection without any encryption! Therefore, it is critical to ensure the configuration only allows strong ciphers greater than or equal to 128 bit to be negotiated with the client. Stronger 256-bit ciphers should be allowed and preferred. In addition, enabling 'SSLHonorCipherOrder' further protects the client from man-in-the-middle downgrade attacks by ensuring the server's preferred ciphers will be used rather than the clients' preferences.

In addition, the RC4 stream ciphers should be disabled, even though they are widely used and have been recommended in previous Apache benchmarks as a means of mitigating attacks based on CBC cipher vulnerabilities. The RC4 ciphers have known cryptographic weaknesses and are no longer recommended. The IETF has published the RFC 7465 standard[4] that would disallow RC4 negotiation for all TLS versions. While the document is somewhat new (Feb 2015), it is expected the RC4 cipher suites will begin to disappear from options in TLS deployments. In the meantime, it is important to ensure that RC4-based cipher suites are disabled in the configuration.

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."

[http://www.phonefactor.com/sslgap/ssl-tls-authentication-patches](http://www.phonefactor.com/sslgap/ssl-tls-authentication-patches) A fix was approved as an Internet Standard as RFC 574, Feb 2010. The workaround which removes the renegotiation is available from OpenSSL as of version 0.9.8l and newer versions. For details: [http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20091111.txt](http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20091111.txt)
The 'SSLInsecureRenegotiation' directive was added in Apache 2.2.15 for web servers linked with OpenSSL version 0.9.8m or later, to allow the insecure renegotiation to provide backward compatibility to clients with the older unpatched SSL implementations. While providing backward compatibility, enabling the 'SSLInsecureRenegotiation' directive also leaves the server vulnerable to man-in-the-middle renegotiation attack CVE-2009-3555.
