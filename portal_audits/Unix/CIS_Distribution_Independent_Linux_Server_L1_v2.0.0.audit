      info        : "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users
and some applications.

Rationale:

Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the
mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also
prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it
to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the
attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a
security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw.

This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate
partition for /tmp."
      solution    : "Configure /etc/fstab as appropriate.

example:
tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime 0 0

OR
Run the following commands to enable systemd /tmp mounting:

systemctl unmask tmp.mount
systemctl enable tmp.mount

Edit /etc/systemd/system/local-fs.target.wants/tmp.mount to configure the /tmp
mount:

[Mount]
What=tmpfs
Where=/tmp
Type=tmpfs
Options=mode=1777,strictatime,noexec,nodev,nosuid

Impact:

Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource
exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition.

Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it,
but in a default installation a disk-based /tmp will essentially have the whole disk available,
as it only creates a single / partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp as with tmpfs
will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the
filesystem much more easily.

/tmp utalizing tmpfs can be resized using the size={size} parameter on the Options line on
the tmp.mount file"

Attackers use SYN flood attacks to perform a denial of service attacked on a system by

half-open connection queue is full, at which time, the SYN cookie functionality kicks in. SYN
cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all. Instead, the kernel simply replies to the
SYN with a SYN|ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that
encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet
was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake
with the specially crafted sequence number. This allows the system to verify that it has
received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no
corresponding SYN in the queue.

Rationale:

Attackers use SYN flood attacks to perform a denial of service attacked on a system by
sending many SYN packets without completing the three way handshake. This will quickly
use up slots in the kernel's half-open connection queue and prevent legitimate connections
from succeeding. SYN cookies allow the system to keep accepting valid connections, even if
under a denial of service attack."

Rationale:

Weak ciphers that are used for authentication to the cryptographic module cannot be relied

The DES, Triple DES, and Blowfish ciphers, as used in SSH, have a birthday bound of
approximately four billion blocks, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain
cleartext data via a birthday attack against a long-duration encrypted session, aka a
\"Sweet32\" attack

The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, does not properly
combine state data with key data during the initialization phase, which makes it easier for
remote attackers to conduct plaintext-recovery attacks against the initial bytes of a stream
by sniffing network traffic that occasionally relies on keys affected by the Invariance
Weakness, and then using a brute-force approach involving LSB values, aka the \"Bar
Mitzvah\" issue

The passwords used during an SSH session encrypted with RC4 can be recovered by an
attacker who is able to capture and replay the session

Error handling in the SSH protocol; Client and Server, when using a block cipher algorithm
in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, makes it easier for remote attackers to recover
certain plaintext data from an arbitrary block of ciphertext in an SSH session via unknown
vectors

The mm_newkeys_from_blob function in monitor_wrap.c, when an AES-GCM cipher is used,

making sure a password is not a dictionary word, it is a certain length, contains a mix of
characters (e.g. alphabet, numeric, other) and more. The following are definitions of the
pam_cracklib.so options.

. try_first_pass - retrieve the password from a previous stacked PAM module. If
not available, then prompt the user for a password.
. retry=3 - Allow 3 tries before sending back a failure.
. minlen=14 - password must be 14 characters or more
. dcredit=-1 - provide at least one digit
. ucredit=-1 - provide at least one uppercase character
. ocredit=-1 - provide at least one special character
. lcredit=-1 - provide at least one lowercase character

ocredit , and lcredit parameters are stored in the /etc/security/pwquality.conf file.
