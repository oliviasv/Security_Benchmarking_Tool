Rationale:

Changes to any software components can have significant effects on the overall security of the operating system. This requirement ensures the software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a trusted vendor.

Accordingly, patches, service packs, device drivers, or operating system components must be signed with a certificate recognized and approved by the organization.

Verifying the authenticity of the software prior to installation validates the integrity of the patch or upgrade received from a vendor. This verifies the software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a trusted vendor. Self-signed certificates are disallowed by this requirement. The operating system should not have to verify the software again. This requirement does not mandate DoD certificates for this purpose; however, the certificate used to verify the software must be from an approved CA."

      info        : "The operating system must implement NIST FIPS-validated cryptography for the following:

provision digital signatures

generate cryptographic hashes

protect data requiring data-at-rest protections in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards.

Rationale:

Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms undermines the purposes of using encryption to protect data. The operating system must implement cryptographic modules adhering to the higher standards approved by the federal government since this provides assurance they have been tested and validated."
      solution    : "Configure the operating system to implement DoD-approved encryption by installing the dracut-fips package.
To enable strict FIPS compliance, the fips=1 kernel option needs to be added to the kernel command line during system installation so key generation is done with FIPS- approved algorithms and continuous monitoring tests in place.
Configure the operating system to implement DoD-approved encryption by following the steps below:
The fips=1 kernel option needs to be added to the kernel command line during system installation so that key generation is done with FIPS-approved algorithms and continuous monitoring tests in place. Users should also ensure that the system has plenty of entropy during the installation process by moving the mouse around, or if no mouse is available, ensuring that many keystrokes are typed. The recommended amount of keystrokes is 256 and more. Less than 256 keystrokes may generate a non-unique key.
Install the dracut-fips package with the following command:

# yum install dracut-fips

Recreate the initramfs file with the following command:
Note: This command will overwrite the existing initramfs file.

# dracut -f

Modify the kernel command line of the current kernel in the grub.cfg file by adding the following option to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX key in the /etc/default/grub file and then rebuild the grub.cfg file:

fips=1

Changes to /etc/default/grub require rebuilding the grub.cfg file as follows:
On BIOS-based machines, use the following command:

# grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

On UEFI-based machines, use the following command:

# grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.cfg

If /boot or /boot/efi reside on separate partitions, the kernel parameter boot=<partition of /boot or /boot/efi> must be added to the kernel command line. You can identify a partition by running the df /boot or df /boot/efi command:

# df /boot
Filesystem 1K-blocks Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda1 495844 53780 416464 12% /boot

To ensure the boot= configuration option will work even if device naming changes occur between boots, identify the universally unique identifier (UUID) of the partition with the following command:

# blkid /dev/sda1
/dev/sda1: UUID='05c000f1-a213-759e-c7a2-f11b7424c797' TYPE='ext4'

For the example above, append the following string to the kernel command line:

boot=UUID=05c000f1-a213-759e-c7a2-f11b7424c797

Reboot the system for the changes to take effect.

Rationale:

It is detrimental for operating systems to provide, or install by default, functionality exceeding requirements or mission objectives.

Operating systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions).

The rsh-server service provides an unencrypted remote access service that does not provide for the confidentiality and integrity of user passwords or the remote session and has very weak authentication.

      info        : "The operating system must shut down upon audit processing failure, unless availability is an overriding concern. If availability is a concern, the system must alert the designated staff in the event of an audit processing failure.

Rationale:

It is critical for the appropriate personnel to be aware if a system is at risk of failing to process audit logs as required. Without this notification, the security personnel may be unaware of an impending failure of the audit capability, and system operation may be adversely affected.

Audit processing failures include software/hardware errors, failures in the audit capturing mechanisms, and audit storage capacity being reached or exceeded.

This requirement applies to each audit data storage repository (i.e., distinct information system component where audit records are stored), the centralized audit storage capacity of organizations (i.e., all audit data storage repositories combined), or both."
      solution    : "Configure the operating system to shut down or notify staff in the event of an audit processing failure.
To add or correct the option to shut down the operating system use the following command:

# auditctl -f 2

Edit the /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules file and add the following line:
Example: vim /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules
Add this line:

-f 2

If availability has been determined to be more important, and this decision is documented with the Authorizing Official, configure the operating system to notify the
appropriate staff in the event of an audit processing failure with the following command:

# auditctl -f 1

Edit the /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules file and add the following line:
Example: vim /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules
Add this line:

-f 1

The audit daemon must be restarted for changes to take effect:

# service auditd restart

Impact:

Kernel log monitoring must also be configured to properly alert designated staff.

The umask controls the default access mode assigned to newly created files. A umask of 077 limits new files to mode 700 or less permissive.

If the account is for an application, the requirement for a umask less restrictive than 077 can be documented, but the user agreement for access to the account must specify that the local interactive user must log on to their account first and then switch the user to the application account with the correct option to gain the account's environment variables.

Rationale:

Terminating an idle session within a short time period reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a management session enabled on the console or console port that has been left unattended. In addition, quickly terminating an idle session will also free up resources committed by the managed network element.

Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, de-allocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level and de-allocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. This does not mean that the operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the inactive session and releases the resources associated with that session."

      info        : "The operating system must be configured so that all local interactive user initialization (dot) files executable search paths contain only paths that resolve to the users home directory.

Rationale:

The executable search path (typically the PATH environment variable) contains a list of directories for the shell to search to find executables. If this path includes the current working directory (other than the user's home directory), executables in these directories may be executed instead of system commands. This variable is formatted as a colon-separated list of directories. If there is an empty entry, such as a leading or trailing colon or two consecutive colons, this is interpreted as the current working directory. If deviations from the default system search path for the local interactive user are required, they must be documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO).

NOTE: Nessus has provided the target output to assist in reviewing the benchmark to ensure target compliance."
      solution    : "Edit the local interactive user initialization files to change any PATH variable statements that reference directories other than their home directory.
Note: The example will be for the smithj user, which has a home directory of /home/smithj.
Utilizing the files listed in the Audit run this command to edit them and change the PATH variable statement.
Example: vim /home/smithj/.bash_profile
Update the PATH accordingly:

:PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/bin

If a local interactive user requires path variables to reference a directory owned by the application, it must be documented with the ISSO.

Executing files from untrusted file systems increases the opportunity for unprivileged users to attain unauthorized administrative access."
