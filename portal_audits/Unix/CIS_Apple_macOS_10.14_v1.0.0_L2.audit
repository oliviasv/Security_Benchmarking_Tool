      info         : "Starting with 10.13 (macOS High Sierra) Apple introduced a service to make it easier to deploy changes from Apple, including software updates, where there are bandwidth constraints to the Internet and fewer constraints and greater bandwidth on the local subnet. This capability can be very valuable for organizations that have throttled and possibly metered Internet connections. In heterogeneous enterprise networks with multiple subnets the effectiveness of this capability would be determined on how many Macs were on each subnet at the time new large updates were made available upstream. This capability requires the use of mac OS clients as P2P nodes for updated Apple content. Unless there is a business requirement to manage operational Internet connectivity bandwidth user endpoints should not store content and act as a cluster to provision data.

https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204675

Rationale:

The main use case for Mac computers is as mobile user endpoints. P2P sharing services should not be enabled on laptops that are using untrusted networks. Content Caching can allow a computer to be a server for local nodes on an untrusted network. While there are certainly logical controls that could be used to mitigate risk, they add to the management complexity, since the value of the service is in specific use cases organizations with the use case described above can accept risk as necessary."

      info        : "Apple's iCloud is a consumer oriented service that allows a user to store data as well as find, control and backup devices that are associated with their Apple ID (Apple account.) The use of iCloud on Enterprise devices should align with the acceptable use policy for devices that are managed as well as confidentiality requirements for data handled by the user. If iCloud is allowed the data that is copied to Apple servers will likely be duplicated on both personal as well as Enterprise devices.

For many users the Enterprise email system may replace many of the available features in iCloud. If using either an Exchange or Google environment email, calendars, notes and contacts can sync to the official Enterprise repository and be available through multiple devices.

Depending on workplace requirements it may not be appropriate to intermingle Enterprise and personal bookmarks, photos and documents. Since the service allows every device associated with the user's ID to synchronize and have access to the cloud storage the concern is not just about having sensitive data on Apple's servers but having that same data on the phone of the teenage son or daughter of an employee. The use of family sharing options can reduce the risk.

Apple's iCloud is just one of many cloud based solutions being used for data synchronization across multiple platforms and it should be controlled consistently with other cloud services in your environment. Work with your employees and configure the access to best enable data protection for your mission.

Rationale:

Organizations must make a risk decision on how their computers will interact with public cloud services.

Adding a synchronization capability for users who have files going back a decade or more and storage may be tight without much larger Apple charges than the free 5GB. Users with multiple computers running 10.12 and above with unique content on each will have issues as well.

Enterprise Users may not be allowed to store Enterprise information in a third party public cloud. In previous implementations iCloud Drive or even DropBox the user selected what files were synchronized even if there were no other controls. The new features synchronize all files in a folder widely used to put working files.

The automatic synchronization of all files in a user's Desktop folder should be disabled

      description : "2.10 Securely delete files as needed"
      info        : "In previous versions of macOS Apple included a capability to securely empty the trash that included overwrites of the existing data. With the wider use of FileVault and other encryption methods and the growing use of Solid State Drives the requirements have changed and the 'Secure Empty Trash' capability has been removed from the GUI. For systems that are not using encryption and continue to use platter-based hard drives there is residual risk that deleted files can still be recovered from the file system.

In previous versions of the Benchmark srm was mentioned as an alternative to the removal of 'Secure Empty Trash.' With the release of macOS 10.12 srm has been removed. There is still an option to erase free space from the command line but Apple has warned that encryption is a better solution

From manual entry for diskutil

NOTE: This kind of secure erase is no longer considered safe. Modern devices have wear-leveling, block-sparing, and possibly-persistent cache hardware, which cannot be completely erased by these commands. The modern solution for quickly and securely erasing your data is encryption. Strongly-encrypted data can be instantly 'erased' by destroying (or losing) the key (password), because this renders your data irretrievable in practical terms. Consider using APFS encryption (File-Vault).

diskutil secureErase freespace 0 /

Rationale:

Securely removing files mitigates the risk of an admin user on the system recovering sensitive files that the user has deleted. It is possible for anyone with physical access to the device to get access if FileVault is not used, or to recover deleted data if the FileVault volume is already mounted. Users and admins of computers containing sensitive information should be screened appropriately or additional security controls should be in place to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Impact:

Securely deleting files can take a long time, with FileVault in place the protection is erasing data within an already encrypted volume.

The system software itself uses keychains for secure storage. Anyone with physical access to an unlocked keychain where the screen is also unlocked can copy all passwords in that keychain. Application access to the login keychain does not keep it unlocked. If you set Apple Mail to check for email every 10 minutes using the keychain for credentials and the keychain to lock every 15 minutes if inactive it will still cause the keychain to lock. The approach recommended here is that the login keychain be set to periodically lock when inactive to reduce the risk of password exposure or unauthorized use of credentials by a third party. The time period that an organization uses will depend on how great the use is of keychain aware applications. Organizations that use Firefox and Thunderbird will have a much different tolerance than those organization using keychain aware applications extensively.

Rationale:

While logged in, the keychain does not prompt the user for passwords for various systems and/or programs. This can be exploited by unauthorized users to gain access to password protected programs and/or systems in the absence of the user. Timing out the keychain can reduce the exploitation window.

      info        : "With 10.9 Apple expanded the capability of the App Store to automatically download macOS applications that were purchased in the App Store on another Mac. This feature can be very desirable for personal Macs or in a small business setting so that all purchased software through Apple's App Store is provisioned on all macOS Computers, just like iOS. This feature may not be desirable in Enterprise environments where the expectations of handling software licenses, tracking software inventory and personal software are different.

Please evaluate your organizations expectations about the use of personal software and software license tracking to align with this setting.

For those organizations that are using Enterprise Apple IDs for their employees the reverse is true. If the user has the username and password for their Apple ID and software is being purchased on that account the user could download the software on other computers they have access to.

      description : "7.8 Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) password"
      info        : "EFI is the software link between the motherboard hardware and the software operating system. EFI determines which partition or disk to load macOS from, it also determines whether the user can enter single-user mode. The main reasons to set a firmware password have been protections against an alternative boot disk, protection against a passwordless root shell through single user mode and protection against firewire DMA attacks. In the past it was not difficult to reset the firmware password by removing RAM but it did make tampering slightly harder and having to remove RAM remediated memory scraping attacks through DMA. It has always been difficult to Manage the firmware password on macOS computers, though some tools did make it much easier.

Apple patched OS X in 10.7 to mitigate the DMA attacks and the use of FileVault 2 Full-Disk Encryption mitigates the risk of damage to the boot volume if an unauthorized user uses a different boot volume or uses Single User Mode. Apple's reliance on the recovery partition and the additional features it provides make controls that do not allow the user to boot into the recovery partition less attractive.

Starting in Late 2010 with the MacBook Air Apple has slowly updated the requirements to recover from a lost firmware password. Apple only supports taking the computer to an Apple authorized service provider. This change makes managing the firmware password effectively more critical if it is used.

Setting the firmware password may be good practice in some environments. We cannot recommend it as a standard security practice at this time.

      description : "7.9 FileVault and Local Account Password Reset using AppleID"
      info        : "Apple has provided services for several years that allowed a user to reset a local account password on a computer using their Apple ID and a service to store the FileVault Master Password with Apple that would be controlled by access to an Apple ID. These distinct services have been more cleanly integrated starting in 10.12.

This integrated service for password and decryption is a concern in Enterprise environments. Normal Enterprise management controls mitigate the risk of external control of organizational systems. The user of the system already has the ability to unlock the disk in order to login and use it and some form of password recovery function is likely already in place for any approved accounts. In addition:

You cannot reset anything but a local account

You need physical access to the computer on a network that can phone home to Apple

Enterprise FileVault management precludes the use of Apple's personal encryption recovery tied to a User's Apple ID

The current login keychain will have to be discarded unless the user remembers the old password

This service allows for organizational computer users to utilize AppleIDs for encryption key escrow and user account management. The use of Apple's services rather than Enterprise services may be considered inappropriate.

      description : "7.11 App Store Password Settings"
      info        : "With OS X 10.11 Apple added settings for password storage for the App Store in macOS. These settings parallel the settings in iOS. As with iOS the choices are a requirement to provide a password after every purchase or to have a 15 minute grace period, and whether to require a password for free purchases. The response to this setting is stored in a cookie and processed by iCloud.

There is plenty of risk information on the wisdom of this setting for parents with children buying games on iPhones and iPads. the most relevant information here is the likelihood that users that are not authorized to download software may have physical access to an unlocked computer where someone who is authorized recently made a purchase. If that is a concern a password should be required at all times for App Store access in the Password Settings controls

Touch ID is integrated with Apple Pay, Safari AutoFill and all Apple store payment options.

Touch ID may be managed by profiles to exclude unacceptable activities depending on the environment. There should be few organizations that cannot utilize some of the TOuch ID functionality.

      description : "7.15 System information backup to remote computers"
      info        : "It is best practice to ensure that local computers are not a single point of failure for logging and auditing records about activity on the computer itself. Whether end user activity or system process information a mechanism should be in place to transfer the logs to another system that is hardened to receive them. A hardened log host reduces the risk of failure or compromise, particularly with user end points. From an enterprise management standpoint those records should be reviewed to ensure that there is not a common exploitable vulnerability, system bug or even hardware issue that can effect other devices in the environment.

With changes in Apple's logging methods in the last few years third party tools appear to be preferred to ensure logs and records are obtained appropriately. Aggressive retention likely requires more space than available on built-in SSDs even if offline Time Machine backups are large and pristine.

Please ensure that solutions to capture and retain log and audit records are in place.
